Anyone getting liens on their eRupee wallets?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1eubo5z/anyone_getting_liens_on_their_erupee_wallets/,r/CryptoIndia,2024-08-17T07:01:24.533000+0000,13,29,"Hey guys,Just wanted to hear from P2P sellers on Binance. I see everyone has switched to accepting payments in eRupee. SInce this change has anyone got their accounts frozen or lien placed due to accepting money from buyers sending eRupee? Most of my liens were level 3 and above so not sure how this would translate to eRupee transactions. Most of the buyers on Binance were using mule accounts so not sure how this will change now as they will simply switch to eRupee to make payments. Any news regarding this would be greatly appreciated.

They‚Äôve branded this as an ‚Äúalternative way to pay‚Äù but that‚Äôs for now. In reality since this money is programmable many people are anticipating in the future that the currency will become more like tokens where you have to spend it before it expires, only can be spent on certain products (like the new carbon tax coming but that‚Äôs a separate topic) ultimately keeping your average person trapped within there system.Fiat as the way we know it seems to be changing forever before our very eyes and maybe it‚Äôs just me but my reality on ETH and BTC is no longer going to be ‚Äúeth to 4k‚Äù or eth to any fiat amount for that matter but much rather actually view it as it‚Äôs own independent currency and be able to use it for its intended purpose.If the ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù are right and money in the future will have expiry dates and the idea of freedom to spend how you like it‚Äôs gone, it may get to a point where government control could restrict you from even buying crypto with their token essentially leaving us and our bags operating out of their system. Maybe i dove in too deep and put the tin foil hat on but i really think we aren‚Äôt prepared for what is to come.To me we are very likely entering a stage where we are going to be entering parallel economies where we will be paying each other in eth and btc outside of the system, our only issue is, what will we peg the value of said crypto to instead of fiat?","{'comment_id': 't1_n5w5tm7', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/ethtrader/comments/1mcs4he/comment/n5w5tm7/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""SPeeD_puncH, this comment  logs the Pay2Post fee, an anti-spam mechanism where a DONUT 'tax' is deducted from your distribution share for each post submitted.

Trump Revives Push for Crypto Bills Amid GOP Revolt and CBDC Fears,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1m1ebtd/trump_revives_push_for_crypto_bills_amid_gop/,r/cryptoddler,2025-07-16T14:39:53.804000+0000,2,0,"President Donald Trump intervened on Tuesday evening to rally House Republicans behind a procedural vote that had earlier failed, threatening to derail a series of crypto-related bills. The legislation includes the GENIUS Act (focused on stablecoin regulation), the CLARITY Act (targeting broader digital asset regulation), and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.Earlier in the day, 13 GOP lawmakers voted against the rule, citing fears that the GENIUS Act could open the door to a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), despite language intended to prohibit it. However, after a meeting with Trump at the White House, 11 of those holdouts agreed to support the re-vote scheduled for Wednesday morning.Critics, including Democrats and DeFi experts, argue that the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts may result in regulatory overreach, stifling innovation and benefiting centralized institutions over open crypto networks. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was among those who opposed the bills, stating the legislation lacked a clear ban on CBDCs and didn‚Äôt allow amendments.Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo Platform added that the GENIUS Act does not fully prevent the Treasury or Federal Reserve from experimenting with CBDCs. He warned that regulating stablecoins could lead to them functioning as de facto CBDCs, undermining the decentralization that defines cryptocurrencies.Instead of focusing on stablecoin regulation, Stadelmann urged Trump to prioritize building a Bitcoin treasury, aligning with the decentralized ethos of the crypto community. He emphasized that Bitcoin supports independent, non-state systems of value transfer, unlike government-regulated stablecoins.The legislative push, part of what the administration calls ‚ÄúCrypto Week,‚Äù underscores Trump‚Äôs attempt to position the U.S. as a leader in digital assets.

Three bills made their way through the House, with one already through the Senate and signed by President Trump.The Clarity Act,passed by the House: Provides much needed clarity on which authoritative body regulates digital asset commodities vs securities. The CTFC will regulate digital asset commodities while the SEC will regulate digital asset securities. This act enables builders to build in the US with confidence.The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act,passed by the House: Prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar (anti-central bank digital currency).

The digital central bank currency will now be introduced at midnight and will be the only valid global currency of payment from midnight on Sunday, December 27, 2025. The World Bank and 99% of central banks have approved this. Remaining cash, regardless of currency, can be exchanged at fixed rates until December 31, 2025, when making purchases in retail stores or at one's own bank. Change will only be credited digitally in the form of the central bank currency. All checking and savings accounts are blocked and will be converted to the new currency during the course of the morning. Stock trading is suspended until after New Year's Day so that securities and stock portfolios can be converted. The dollar, the euro, and all known currencies will lose their value from midnight on December 31, 2025. Therefore, a fixed exchange rate for the new digital central bank currency has been set at the same time. This allows retailers to accept any amount of foreign currency.

My thoughts:Hedera has significantly developed the concept of spheres, which are private DLTs, and is only using the public network for connections between spheres. This considerably reduces the potential use of the public DLT compared to what we thought years ago.At least as I see it, in most cases, companies want privacy, and they will use Hyperledger. Spheres provide a good solution for that.The use of a public network must be strongly driven by legislation. Companies always prioritize privacy. That said, some interesting use cases for Hedera include:Neuron: Flight trackingDovu: Carbon credit marketplaceEmtech: CBDC/Stablecoin for cross-border payments (rumored involvement with SWIFT, for example)EQTY Lab, Intel, and NVIDIA unveiled Verifiable Compute: Ensuring AI models‚Äô data sources are traceable (crucial for intellectual property rights and preventing data corruption)All of these only make sense if governments require transparency and immutability to prevent corruption. The irony is that the main public DLT use case is Bitcoin (in this moment the real king), a currency created to undermine centralized banking systems.  For that reason , many governments refused all criptos (defense mechanism) and these years the adoption has been very small. Yet, for utility-driven public DLTs to succeed, criptos actually need government support.The biggest hope I see is that the banking system has enough regulatory requirements that could make certain cryptocurrencies viable. The SWIFT system, CBDCs, and stablecoins seem to be gaining real traction‚Äîfar from the hype-driven narratives of ""moonboys.""In a real-world crypto utility scenario, I see HBAR as a definite top 5 contender (for me, number 1). In fact, I am convinced it will be the first cryptocurrency to launch an ETF after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although it has a relatively low market cap compared to others, and on the stock market, this ETF could be more appealing than many others because Hedera is a serious project with major players in the Governing Council.However, my main question is whether the crypto market will truly be as significant as people expect.That said, cases like SIX (Spanish and Swiss stock exchanges market, big player with a strong influence in european governments), the Nairobi Stock Exchange, and relevant banks in Korea and Australia are very interesting.I wouldn‚Äôt rule out that when Charles Adkins proposed expanding the Governing Council, they were considering adding global public institutions as nodes and aiming for a public-private collaboration between major corporations and relevant public organizations.Will they achieve it?

It\'s price cannot be understood without knowing both the face value of the nation state and it\'s metal value because even foreign coins have the option of being returned home for full value. This is why something like the Franc is still worth more than it\'s gold value inside the British Kingdom. There\'s a huge currency market at this time trying to price the spread.Similarly, the official prohibition of interest rates in Europe at the time lead to the flourishing of bills of exchange. They attempted to hide it through the guise of exchange rates. The European bills of exchange are directly inspired by those found in the middle east, however I know nothing of the market there which preceded the European one. Drumm\'s new research findings should be incorporated here.Near the end the author says that commodity money systems have no hierarchy in contrast with credit-based systems. This is perhaps untrue, however the fault may be on money view theorists here who haven\'t clarified the concept of a ""hierarchy of money"" well enough yet. Commodity monies do potentially have a hierarchy, briefly outlined under Gresham\'s law where ""bad money drives out good money"". Bimetalist systems also existed. It is undoubtedly true that very few people held gold. Instead when the common person went to the bazaar they often dealt in other ""ribawi"" goods like wheat, barley, salt, and dates. Similarly, there may have been a hierarchy of commodity money at the time. Today the international hierarchy of money is ranked according to market liquidity, however going back other aspects like durability (ig, date fruit) may also be important to consider.While the author has considered the institutional hierarchy of credit in a domestic hierarchy, it appears they haven\'t noted the international hierarchy also has a hierarchy. What money view theorists haven\'t noticed is that Merhling ranks each hierarchy differently. Domestic hierarchy is ranked by funding liquidity whereas the international hierarchy is ranked by market liquidity. So there\'s room for the author to improve moneyview concepts as well.', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_n2v31m0', 'upvote': 2, 'depth': 1, 'permalink': '/r/moneyview/comments/1lxrlvj/comment/n2v31m0/', 'parent_id': 't1_n2prre3', 'comment_body': 'Would mind sharing the reference(s) for Colin Drumm?

In short, not to be too technical The xrpl ledger is where all cbdc would be connected and convert from euro to US dollar or euro to yen etc. Now the use of xrp is not necessary to do this conversion but the fastest way is to use XRP so it would convert from euro to xrp then xrp to dollar for example. However, again xrp is not necessary required but if this happens then it will burn 0.00001 xrp per transaction if I am correct. Also the higher value for xrp the better because imagine bank want to transfer 1 millions euro they will need 300k plus xrp today for this transaction. If all play well and all partner with ripple use xrp ledger it will be massive for xrp price because also tokenisation is possible and that use xrp as well. an example in Europe is to check LCX which is basically Lichtenstein they are tokenising lot of asset on xrpl that burn xrp every time they do it. The big deal now is cbdc is forbidden in USA but banks can connect to xrpl directly as well like Bank of America did in the past. Ripple partnered with hundreds of banks but what I think is all banks are awaiting for sec lawsuit to finish or settle for good in USA before to make any move, however somehow it seems in October this year swift and most of bank seems to have discussed to go live with cryptocurrency based ledger but everyone is speculating which crypto it is.

They tolerate cryptocurrencies because they understand what crypto enthusiasts do not: that the true seat of financial power lies in the ability to issue credit, not simply to shuffle ""coins"" around. Until that monopoly is broken, cryptocurrencies will remain harmless‚Äîanother asset class for central bank trading desks to profit from, not a threat to their control.Centralized Ledgers: The Supreme Transaction TechnologyAt its core, banking is simply the maintenance of a ledger‚Äîcredits and debits‚Äîrecorded centrally, trusted because of the legal and institutional frameworks that support it. This system is astonishingly cost-effective: modern banks can settle millions of transactions a day, at minimal energy cost, through centralized databases.By contrast, cryptocurrencies operate by replicating the same information thousands of times across a decentralized network, consuming enormous computational resources. Every Bitcoin transaction must be verified through the wasteful burning of electricity known as ""proof of work,"" resulting in an energy sink that dwarfs entire nations (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, 2023). Bitcoin‚Äôs network can barely handle 7 transactions per second. Visa processes tens of thousands (Visa, 2020).The simple reality is that a centralized ledger is the financial equivalent of a modern highway system‚Äîsmooth, cheap, and reliable‚Äîwhereas cryptocurrencies are a wagon trail built with space-age materials: no matter the polish, it remains slow, crude, and primitive.Fractional Reserve Banking: The True Alchemy of WealthThe greatest economic engine humanity has ever created is not ""currency"" but credit. Through fractional reserve banking, a small amount of base money can underpin vast networks of productive investment. One dollar deposited in a bank can support the issuance of many dollars in loans, allowing economic activity to grow geometrically (McLeay, Radia, & Thomas, 2014).Cryptocurrencies, in contrast, cling to a hard-money idealism more suited to ancient empires than modern economies. Like medieval merchants weighed down by sacks of gold, cryptocurrency systems are inherently rigid. They cannot elastically expand to meet the credit needs of a growing economy.Central Banks' Smirking Tolerance of CryptoFar from fearing cryptocurrencies, central banks and governments view them as a convenient sideshow. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their offspring have been easily corralled into the existing system: taxed, regulated, traded, and profited from. They have been reduced to casino chips on the balance sheets of financial institutions.Meanwhile, the true monopoly of power‚Äîthe ability to create credit denominated in state-backed fiat‚Äîremains firmly in the hands of the central banking cartels. Cryptocurrencies do not offer an escape from this regime. They are allowed to flourish because they pose no real challenge. They are simply another asset to speculate on, like pork bellies or gold, and a profitable one at that (Bank for International Settlements, 2023).The central banks smile upon cryptocurrency not because they misunderstand it, but because they understand it perfectly.The Real Path to Financial DecentralizationIf there is to be a true financial revolution, it will not come from ""digital cash."" It will come from restoring the power to create credit to local institutions‚Äîsmall banks, cooperatives, cities, and regions.During the 19th century ""free banking era"" in America, banks issued their own notes, responding directly to the credit needs of their local economies (Selgin, 1988). It was not perfect, but it was far more decentralized than today‚Äôs globalist banking regime dominated by a handful of central authorities.Modern cryptography and open-source software could provide the technological backbone for local credit systems without needing the bloated, parasitic machinery of Wall Street and central banks. But for that to happen, there must be a change in law, allowing diverse institutions to issue and manage their own forms of credit.Decentralization should not mean scattering ancient ""coins"" across cyberspace. It should mean building networks of local financial sovereignty, ending the monopoly of distant capitals over every community‚Äôs economic life.In ConclusionCryptocurrencies are not the harbinger of financial freedom. They are a sophisticated decoy‚Äîan ancient tool wrapped in futuristic packaging. Meanwhile, central banks remain secure, their true source of power‚Äîthe control of credit creation‚Äîuntouched and unchallenged.A real revolution in finance would not worship digital ""gold coins."" It would shatter the central banks' monopoly on credit and resurrect the local issuance of money. Until then, cryptocurrencies are not a revolution. They are a profitable distraction‚Äîa high-tech carnival ride operated by the very powers they claim to oppose.References:Bernanke, B. (1995).

Commercial bank take a cut on almost everything and are very slow. If we have a Central Bank Digital Currency and we have a global decentralised financial system backed by Bitcoin or other crypto technology. There is no remaining use for classical commercial banks. The whole system is based on trust and them being the best bad option. The moment we have a cheaper and faster system they will disappear. The government on the other hand will provide a liable alternative to Defi system keeping them in check. I believe this duopoly will be the foundation of our future financial system.

This shift signals less hostility, more structure.Innovation Green LightBuilders apps, wallets, startups can start integrating both CBDC and crypto systems. This could open up jobs, DeFi apps, P2P tools  all inside a legal sandbox.Faster TransactionsIf you can send crypto and Digital Rupee in one app, the experience becomes seamless, especially for remittances and freelancers.Regulated On-RampsP2P might finally get protection under law.

The more I learn, the more concerned I feel about where India stands in this global shift. Around the world, countries are moving fast, adopting crypto and blockchain in big ways. But in India, the pace seems slow and cautious‚Äîalmost like we‚Äôre stuck in neutral while the rest of the world speeds ahead.I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîare we really falling behind? And if yes, what can we do to catch up or even lead? So I did a deep study of how different countries are handling crypto, where the world is heading, and what India can do differently. I‚Äôve written down everything I found in a simple and honest way, based on what I learned myself.How the World Is Moving Ahead with Crypto and BlockchainGlobally, the crypto and blockchain industry is booming. In 2025, the crypto market is expanding like never before. Many experts believe Bitcoin could cross $100,000 soon, and newer technologies built on blockchain‚Äîlike DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and AI integration‚Äîare growing fast.DeFi lets people lend, borrow, or trade money without needing a bank, using smart contracts. It‚Äôs becoming one of the biggest uses of blockchain right now. NFTs, which started with digital art, are now being used for things like event tickets, in-game items, and even real estate ownership. This is opening up a whole new way of doing business online.I also saw that sustainability is becoming a big focus. Many crypto projects are shifting to more energy-efficient systems like proof-of-stake, which uses much less electricity than traditional mining. Governments are also exploring their own digital currencies. These are called CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), and they‚Äôre based on blockchain too. The fact that countries are building digital versions of their own money shows how seriously the world is taking this technology.But while all of this is happening, I feel like India is moving too slowly.India‚Äôs Current Situation with CryptoWhen I looked into India‚Äôs rules around crypto, I found a lot of restrictions and confusion.Crypto is not banned, but it‚Äôs not recognized as legal tender either. That means you can buy and sell crypto as an investment, but you can‚Äôt use it to pay for things like you do with rupees. On top of that, there‚Äôs a 30% tax on profits and a 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on every transaction, which makes trading very expensive and discourages small investors.There was a proposed law in 2021 called the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill. It wanted to ban all private cryptocurrencies and allow only a government-backed digital currency. But that bill was never passed, and now we‚Äôre stuck in a space where nobody knows what the future holds.India has also introduced Anti-Money Laundering rules for crypto businesses. This improves security, but it also adds more paperwork and regulation for startups and exchanges. The biggest issue is the uncertainty. Investors, developers, and businesses don‚Äôt have a clear direction or policy, so many of them hesitate to get involved.Despite all these issues, crypto is still growing in India. People are curious, especially the younger generation. But our rules are holding back the full potential.What Other Countries Are Doing BetterI compared India with other countries to see how we stack up, and it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre falling behind in many areas.In the USA, the government is actively working on crypto regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a task force focused on digital assets. They‚Äôre working on bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act to manage stablecoins. Even former President Trump signed an executive order on digital finance, showing that crypto is being taken seriously at the highest level.China took a tough approach by banning crypto exchanges, mining, and trading. But now there are signs that they might be changing their view. Some reports say they‚Äôre planning to include crypto in their anti-money laundering laws, which could be the first step towards softening their ban. Even with restrictions, China is deeply involved in blockchain innovation.The UAE is a great example of how supportive rules can create a healthy ecosystem. They created a special authority called VARA (Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority) to regulate crypto. They also introduced laws like the Payment Token Services Regulation, which requires crypto tokens used for payments to be backed by the local currency. This clear, balanced approach has made UAE a top destination for crypto businesses.Pakistan was a surprise for me. Even though their laws are still evolving, they‚Äôve formed the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and are working on legalizing crypto to attract investment. They‚Äôre at least trying to keep up and not get left behind.Compared to these countries, India‚Äôs strict taxes, unclear policies, and regulatory delays are pushing us behind in this fast-moving space.What the Future Looks Like for Crypto and BlockchainAfter all my reading, I‚Äôm convinced the future of crypto and blockchain is very bright.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are expected to grow as more people adopt them. DeFi and NFTs will keep expanding, and blockchain will find even more uses in areas like voting, supply chain tracking, real estate, and healthcare. Blockchain is also merging with AI, making systems smarter and more secure.More countries are launching their own CBDCs, and governments around the world are making rules that bring clarity. This helps businesses grow with confidence and brings more people into the crypto economy.But if India doesn‚Äôt catch up, we risk missing out on all these opportunities.Why India Risks Falling BehindHere‚Äôs why I believe India is at risk:Our rules are confusing. Businesses don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs allowed and what‚Äôs not.Taxes are too high. A 30% tax and 1% TDS on every trade makes it tough for regular investors.Startups find it hard to innovate in this strict environment.Countries like the UAE and USA have better systems in place, and even Pakistan is moving faster.If we don‚Äôt act, we could lose out on foreign investment, new jobs, and technological growth. We might even end up depending on other countries for blockchain tech, which could hurt our independence.What India Can Do to Catch Up and LeadBased on everything I‚Äôve learned, here‚Äôs what I think India should do:Create clear rules: We need to define the legal status of crypto and build a clear, supportive framework. A special regulatory body like VARA in the UAE could help bring structure and trust.Encourage innovation: The government should support blockchain startups with funding, incubation programs, and R&D. Launching our own CBDC could be a big step forward too.Lower the taxes: A more balanced tax policy would encourage more people to invest and trade. High taxes right now are scaring people away.Spread awareness: Many people still don‚Äôt fully understand what crypto and blockchain are. We need education programs, workshops, and courses to build public knowledge.Use our strengths: India has one of the largest pools of tech talent in the world. With the right policies, we can turn this into a major advantage and become a global leader.Collaborate internationally: India should be part of global discussions on crypto to learn from others and share our own progress.If we take these steps, I truly believe India can move from being a latecomer to a leader.What Happens If We Don‚ÄôtIf India keeps delaying reforms, we might face serious setbacks:Investors will prefer other countries.Our tech talent might move abroad where they have more freedom to innovate.We‚Äôll lose out on job creation and economic benefits.We‚Äôll depend on others for future technology, which isn‚Äôt good for our long-term growth.We have the potential‚Äîbut we have to move now.My Final ThoughtsAfter researching all of this, it‚Äôs clear to me that crypto and blockchain aren‚Äôt just a trend‚Äîthey‚Äôre a major part of the future. India has everything it needs to succeed: smart people, a huge population, and a growing tech sector. But we‚Äôre falling behind because of unclear rules, high taxes, and hesitation.Countries like the USA, UAE, and even Pakistan are making bold moves while we‚Äôre still debating. If we don‚Äôt fix this soon, we‚Äôll miss out on massive opportunities. But with the right approach‚Äîclear rules, support for innovation, and public education‚ÄîIndia can catch up and even lead the world in this space. I really hope we don‚Äôt wait too long.Where I Got My InformationTo make sure I understood the full picture, I referred to several reliable sources:KYC Hub: Cryptocurrency Regulations in IndiaOutlook India: Crypto Regulations in India 2025ComplyCube: Cryptocurrency Regulation in India 2024Atlantic Council: Crypto Regulation in the USGlobal Legal Insights: Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Laws USACMS Law: Crypto Regulation in ChinaKYC Hub: Cryptocurrency Regulations in the UAECoinpedia: Crypto Regulations in Pakistan 2024Exploding Topics: Cryptocurrency Trends 2025Forbes: Top Cryptocurrency Trends 2025World Economic Forum: Cryptocurrency Regulations 2025","{'comment_id': 't1_msnla7n', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/ShareMarketupdates/comments/1ko5yz3/comment/msnla7n/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""I'm very happy to welcome you tor/ShareMarketupdates!

Worrying of my last P2P Transaction with UPI on Binance (No freeze yet),https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1guuvim/worrying_of_my_last_p2p_transaction_with_upi_on/,r/CryptoIndia,2024-11-19T11:19:19.924000+0000,9,54,"Recently I did a p2p Transaction on Binance where I sold my usdt for inr through UPI. I usually do p2p transaction when merchant has 100% positive feedback and been trading since last 6 months.So what happened is It's been 20 days of the transaction, it was a UPI transaction, and he sent me around 20K in my account for some usdt.He is a verified merchant with 99.6% positive (earlier 99.9) feedback and executed over 2500 trades.Yesterday, i thought to recheck his feedback section for getting reassured, but guess what, there was one negative feedback saying his account got freezed after trading with him. However, It's only one negative feedback out of those thousands positive ones.Now I am really tensed. Currently my account is working fine. I don't want to risk my funds. Also I have spent a lot of money out of which he sent to me. And send those money to my another bank account tooWhat should I do now? If my account gets freezed, my 2 bank accounts are vulnerable of getting freezed.Also to all those people i have sent money, will their account also freeze?Please answer.","{'comment_id': 't1_lxwzncp', 'upvote': 11, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1guuvim/comment/lxwzncp/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'Kuch bhi ho sakta hai , bhagwaan bharose', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_lxx7ric', 'upvote': 2, 'depth': 1, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1guuvim/comment/lxx7ric/', 'parent_id': 't1_lxwzncp', 'comment_body': 'Uske baare me mt worry karo, uss account me paise mat rakhna bss', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_lxxceq2', 'upvote': 2, 'depth': 2, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1guuvim/comment/lxxceq2/', 'parent_id': 't1_lxx7ric', 'comment_body': 'Plus us account se apne kisi account me online transfer mat karna nahi to vo bhi sath me jayenge, atm se nikal ke direct transfer', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_lxxsejt', 'upvote': 2, 'depth': 3, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1guuvim/comment/lxxsejt/', 'parent_id': 't1_lxxceq2', 'comment_body': 'Bhai Maine minimum 5-6 logo ko apne account se paise bheje hain uske baad, unka kya?

Complete ban on physical money and corruption - yay or nah?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1m3zrtc/complete_ban_on_physical_money_and_corruption_yay/,r/AskEconomics,2025-07-19T16:01:00.411000+0000,0,11,"Sorry if this not the right subreddit. I have a question related to the current economic situation prevailing in India. I am wondering if a complete ban of physical money and making everything digital would fix corruption. With the raise in digital payments and UPI in India, I think it makes sense to explore a possibility where the physical money no longer exists. By this, I do not mean abolish Rupee but rather reduce its existence to a mere digital entity. Although demonetization tried this years ago, it was not effective back then because of the reliance on physical cash and an implementation that took many by shock.Should the government explore such an approach, what do you think would be the dire consequences?I could think of the following:Extreme transparency - meaning every transaction ever done could be audited.Potential fix of corruption??Education and reach - could this ever reach the vast corners of the nation?Security - security and transparency go hand in hand, but how secure can it be?Privacy - strict noStock market - crash? how long would investors panic?Will this always be a far cry?

By routing rewards through this network, the companies aim to reduce on-chain friction while expanding usage of stablecoins like USDC, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar.JPMorgan and Coinbase Unlock Crypto Access for Millions Through Chase IntegrationThis partnership signals a dramatic pivot from JPMorgan‚Äôs historically cautious stance on cryptocurrencies. The banking giant is now embracingblockchaininnovation through practical use cases such as tokenized deposits and digital rewards. Their internal platform, Kinexys, has been experimenting with permissioned deposit tokens‚Äîlaying the groundwork for broader digital money strategies like this new Coinbase collaboration.Coinbase, on the other hand, stands to benefit from massive market exposure. With over 80 million Chase customers now having the option to integrate directly with its platform, Coinbase is positioning itself as the preferred exchange for mainstream users seeking trusted fiat-to-crypto pathways. The timing aligns with its recent S&P 500 inclusion and increased investor confidence.The introduction of USDC as a rewards option may also redefine loyalty programs across the financial sector. This is the first time a major U.S. rewards program is offering direct redemption into acryptoasset. By enabling reward-to-stablecoin conversions, the companies are not only enhancing customer choice but also encouraging wider use of digital assets for everyday spending and transfers.Importantly, this deal comes shortly after U.S. banking regulators clarified guidelines for crypto custody and on-chain services.

The PSA DD You‚Äôre Looking For üëÄ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1mbz10b/the_psa_dd_youre_looking_for/,r/Superstonk,2025-07-29T01:54:29.040000+0000,841,100,"SlabBusters, Push Start Arcade, and the Future of GameStop x PSA: Something Big Is Coming!So GameStop just dropped a new teaser for ‚ÄúPush Start Arcade‚Äù in collaboration with PSA. On the surface it looks like a stylish arcade-themed collectible tie-in. But if you‚Äôre actually paying attention‚Äîlike, really paying attention‚Äîthis is the most intentional signaling we‚Äôve seen from GME yet.Let me walk through what I think they‚Äôre telegraphing, why ‚ÄúSlabBusters‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a meme, and how this may be setting the stage for a full-blown transformation of how physical collectibles are authenticated, traded, and stored‚Äîwith GameStop sitting dead center in the middle of the slab economy.‚∏ªFirst, the SetupWe‚Äôve got a neon PSA x GameStop terminal front and center with the phrase ‚ÄúPush Start‚Äù above it. There‚Äôs a glowing vault aesthetic, ‚ÄúVault Rules‚Äù on the wall, and a character about to interact with the machine.On the wall is a very intentional Ghostbusters parody that says ‚ÄúSlabBusters‚Äù‚Äîusing a stylized bunny inside a red strike-through like the classic logo. And just beneath it, what looks like a movie poster, complete with credits. Not just branding‚Äîstorytelling.We also see nods to Pok√©mon, One Piece, basketball culture, and arcade nostalgia all crammed into a single frame. This is a fusion of collectible culture, gaming culture, and retail logistics. Nothing about it feels accidental.‚∏ªNow, What Is a ‚ÄúSlabBuster‚Äù?At face value, a slab is a graded card inside a tamper-proof plastic case. PSA, CGC, Beckett‚Äîthese are the grading companies that validate a card‚Äôs condition and seal it into a ‚Äúslab,‚Äù giving it liquidity, status, and price anchoring in the secondary market.So what does it mean to be a ‚ÄúSlabBuster‚Äù?In one sense, it could be a jab at people who crack open slabs to resubmit for regrades or flip into other grading systems. But in this context, it feels like something bigger. Something structural. GameStop isn‚Äôt just mocking people who crack slabs open‚Äîthey‚Äôre positioning themselves as the entity that‚Äôs about to break the grading ecosystem open entirely.‚∏ªThink Bigger: Vault-Backed, Digitally-Native CollectiblesWhat if this whole ‚ÄúPush Start Arcade‚Äù vault isn‚Äôt about retail shelf space at all?What if GameStop is about to launch a completely digital trading experience, where:‚Ä¢	Cards are submitted physically at a GameStop location (or drop-boxed in),
‚Ä¢	PSA grades them and slaps them in a slab,
‚Ä¢	But the slab itself goes into a GameStop Vault, and
‚Ä¢	The user receives a digital twin‚Äîpossibly an NFT or unique token‚Äîthat represents ownership and custody of that specific slab.From there, it could be instantly listed, traded, or fractionalized on a GameStop-powered marketplace without ever requiring the end user to physically touch the card again.This isn‚Äôt just eBay 2.0. It‚Äôs Vault-native trading. Think StockX or PWCC but for everyone‚Äîand plugged directly into storefronts, gamification layers, maybe even looped into gaming universes down the road.‚∏ªAnd It Gets Deeper‚Ä¶Look at those Vault Rules.‚ÄúNo pre-slabbing in the lobby.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo mixing artificial and regular intelligence.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo racing after chase cards.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not try to shuffle the slabs.‚ÄùThey‚Äôre not just jokes‚Äîthey‚Äôre constraints on how a system works. They‚Äôre describing the terms of interaction inside a closed trading environment. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúpre-slab‚Äù because grading happens upstream. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúshuffle slabs‚Äù because everything is authenticated, inventoried, and possibly tokenized. And if ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is a factor, that might hint at AI-assisted pregrading, authenticity verification, or automated rarity scoring.Everything in that teaser is screaming infrastructure. Not gimmick. System.‚∏ªWhy GameStop?Because they‚Äôre one of the few brands that sits at the intersection of:‚Ä¢	Retail logistics (physical stores, reverse logistics, trade-ins),
‚Ä¢	Gaming and nostalgia (the collectible demographic lives here),
‚Ä¢	Crypto/NFT infrastructure (they already launched a wallet and NFT marketplace),
‚Ä¢	And now, via PSA, they have access to the most credible grading pipeline in the hobby.And most importantly, they have something no grading company has ever had: a captive, culturally-aligned, brick-and-mortar footprint for intake, onboarding, and community immersion.‚∏ªSlabBusters = Culture LayerWhat if this isn‚Äôt just a collectibles tool, but a culture layer?The idea of ‚ÄúSlab Busters‚Äù might not be about rejecting slabs, but changing what a slab means. It‚Äôs no longer a static piece of plastic‚Äîit‚Äôs now a node in a connected system:‚Ä¢	It can be transferred instantly
‚Ä¢	Traded digitally
‚Ä¢	Pulled from a vault on demand
‚Ä¢	Upgraded, re-graded, tracked, and authenticated in real-time
‚Ä¢	Possibly even linked to a digital companion experienceThink Pok√©mon meets Robinhood meets Ghostbusters, with GameStop playing both platform and gatekeeper.‚∏ªTL;DR for the DegeneratesGameStop isn‚Äôt just teasing a PSA partnership‚Äîthey‚Äôre soft-launching a collectibles trading system that might vault slabs physically, represent them digitally, and turn grading into a real-time gaming experience. SlabBusters is more than a pun. It‚Äôs a hint that they‚Äôre about to crack open the entire graded collectibles economy and rewrite the terms of engagement.And if you‚Äôre still asking what GME is doing with all that cash?This might be it.Edit: AI is bad‚Ä¶ mmmk","{'comment_id': 't1_n5pxm16', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/Superstonk/comments/1mbz10b/comment/n5pxm16/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""Why GME?||What is DRS?|| Low karma apesfeed the bot here||Superstonk Discord||Community Post:Open Forum||Superstonk:Now with GIFs - Learn moreTo ensure your post doesn't get removed, please respond to this comment with how this post relates to GME the stock or Gamestop the company.Please up- and downvote this comment tohelp us determine if this post deserves a place on r/Superstonk!"", 'replies': []}","{'comment_id': 't1_n5q2otu', 'upvote': 127, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/Superstonk/comments/1mbz10b/comment/n5q2otu/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'I think they‚Äôll offer a way to play with them.

I think having the user's create the rulesets for the game is the only way it works, but even the comparable Tabletop Simulator on PC has issues with this and GameStop is a much bigger target that relies massively on having a good relationship with these two companies, especially Nintendo.What's needed is maybe a slow approach, where smaller TCGs agree to incorporate PSArcade slab-backed decks into a first party video game.

"UPI for foreigners -üëΩ- a review of MONY, a cashless payment app",https://www.reddit.com/r/india_tourism/comments/1i9wm94/upi_for_foreigners_a_review_of_mony_a_cashless/,r/india_tourism,2025-01-25T20:47:23.777000+0000,44,46,"I recently traveled to India for a month-long trip and landed in Mumbai. Before my trip, I had done extensive research about using UPI (Unified Payments Interface) for digital payments and learned that having a local Indian mobile number was essential. So, I picked up an Airtel SIM at the airport to get started.I tried multiple UPI apps to set up my account, but the process was frustratingly slow and riddled with issues ‚Äî mostly delays with KYC verification. Out of all the apps I tried, MONY was the only one that provided a relatively quick and seamless experience. By the 4th or 5th day of my trip, I was all set up with UPI through MONY, with no further hiccups.Here‚Äôs my breakdown of MONY‚Äôs features:FeesIn terms of fees, MONY charges a 3.5% service fee, but they do provide some cash back and first-time top up offers as well I think. This might sound slightly privileged, but the fees are really not an issue for me as the convenience of a cashless payment system in India far outweighs trying to figure out each denomination and being constantly worried about misplacing my physical rupees.PaymentsPayments through the app were hassle-free and lightning fast. Whether I was paying street vendors via QR codes, buying groceries, or transferring money to friends, the process was smooth. The app supports payments either through the QR code or the UPI address and provides detailed transaction histories for easy tracking. Sometimes, but very rarely, occasional issues may occur with certain vendors and merchants, which happened to me at museum tuckshops when I was trying to buy a patty with chai, but after a few tries again, it generally would work - make sure you check with the vendor if their QR codes are correct too!Ease of UseThe user interface of MONY is intuitive, even for someone like me, who was completely new to UPI systems. The setup process was straightforward once my KYC was approved. The app provides clear instructions for linking your bank account (I paid via my WISE, aka Transferwise card) and setting up a UPI PIN. Also, the in-app support / customer service is very responsive, which came in handy when I had issues.Customer ServiceWhen I was in Jaipur, I had purchased composite tickets (Jaipur Darshan) via the Government of Rajasthan website, and I had made a payment that failed the first time via UPI, so I tried again, and it failed a second time. Since I was buying for myself and two other foreigners, I ended spending 6600 rupees that simply got sucked into the cyberspace black hole. I was very upset and worried, but I contacted the MONY app customer service, they got back to me in a matter of minutes and told me they would Investigate both the payments - obviously I gave them a the relevant information that they had requested (also, top tip: make sure you have a WhatsApp account you‚Äôre active on and provide that number when registering!) - I think it took them a day or less, but they resolved it and paid the rupees back into my UPI wallet. That definitely solidified my trust in the MONY team ultimately.Payments In/WithdrawalsIn terms of payments into your UPI wallet, I‚Äôve tested with my local Indian friends and it can‚Äôt work, i.e. you will not be able to receive payments from anyone as a foreigner since you aren‚Äôt registered with a local bank (and trust me that process of opening a bank account as a foreigner is a complicated one, as I‚Äôm sure is the case in many countries). And in terms of withdrawals, I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre able to withdraw, so I recommend budgeting BUDGETINGBUDGETING! It‚Äôs a big part of being money savvy and I was left with only about 200 rupees on my last day, which I just tipped a chaiwalla (try Dada Ki Chai at Assi Ghat in Varanasi!) in the end. I think, when you close your UPI account, they offer the option to withdraw back into your bank account, in my case - WISE, but I didn‚Äôt really go down that route so can‚Äôt attest to it.Anyway, all in all, it made my experience significantly easier. I‚Äôm sure you could try other similar apps, but MONY deffo stood out during my trip for its reliability and excellent customer service. For international travelers planning to use UPI in India, I highly recommend starting with MONY.","{'comment_id': 't1_m95qm5h', 'upvote': 4, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/india_tourism/comments/1i9wm94/comment/m95qm5h/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'I was reading about such services that they only allow payments to merchant accounts.

This fluctuation in currency value is driven by multiple factors, including rising treasury yields, increasing crude oil prices, and capital outflows by foreign investors from Indian stocks. Such circumstances have a noticeable impact on the financial decisions of expats.For Indian expatriates, the depreciation of the rupee significantly affects remittances. The unfavorable exchange rate means that sending money back home might cost more, ultimately lowering the purchasing power of recipients. As a result, those transferring funds must consider the most efficient ways to manage their remittances.In light of these developments, the article offers a guide on various remittance options available to UAE residents. Traditional banking methods are among the choices, yet digital platforms like NOW Money are gaining popularity due to their competitive exchange rates and lower transaction fees. These emerging platforms provide a great alternative for making smart financial choices.Moreover, an overview of the latest trends in cross-border payments reveals the integration of technology, such as blockchain and mobile-first financial services, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in the UAE. These innovations are changing how expatriates approach money transfers, making the process cheaper and faster.To help maximize the value of remittances, the article suggests practical tips for expats. Timing transfers to take advantage of favorable exchange rates can make a significant difference, and utilizing mobile wallets allows for swift transactions with minimal fees.In summary, as the Indian rupee experiences this significant downturn, it becomes essential for UAE expatriates to stay informed about their remittance options. By understanding the current economic landscape and exploring innovative transfer methods, individuals can ensure that they make the most of their hard-earned money while supporting their families back in India.For further details, you can check the original articlehere.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:49:24.242049,"['Informative', 'None', ""Rupee's decline affects UAE expats' remittances; exploring efficient options like digital platforms is advised.""]","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

The committee proposed a study to pursue what methods Cambodia may have to effectively regulate the cryptocurrencies to generate income, but without losing the investment interest they generate.ScopeThe Joint-Committee on Digital Assets has proposed a study of various virtual asset regulatory bodies around the world, their corresponding statutes, and the reporting and enforcement mechanisms attached to these bodies.Studies of Digital Asset RegulationThe National Bank of Cambodia has nominated the following regulatory authorities, upon concurrence with the committee in the National Assembly, as the appropriate entities for a case study on regulation of digital assets. Particularly the National Bank of Cambodia representatives will be looking for how the authorities work under the framework of the legislation, and how effective each is at enforcing its policies. There will be several levels of evaluation for the case studies, including level of income generated, influx rate of foreign digital-asset related enterprises, strictness of exchange licensing, number of permitted currencies, general transaction and dollar-value volume flow.Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), Dubai, UAENational Commission of Digital Assets (NCDA), El SalvadorCentral Bank of Bahrain (CBB), BahrainSecurities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong, ChinaThai Securities and Exchange Commission (Thai SEC), ThailandAfter the study is completed, the Joint Committee will examine the results and craft a regulatory authority for Cambodia that aligns most closely to Cambodia‚Äôs goals, driven by success indicators as evaluated from the various regulatory authorities. The National Bank of Cambodia will also be sending representatives to discuss with exchanges, equipment manufacturers, and industry leaders at conferences such as Bitcoin 2026, Coinfest, Bitcoin Asia, WOW Summit, Token 2049, Future Blockchain Summit, Hong Kong FinTech Week, Paris Blockchain Week, and Consensus 2026.","{'comment_id': 't1_n5r2ff1', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/GlobalPowers/comments/1mbwlg7/comment/n5r2ff1/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'Overheard in ASEAN HQ‚Ä¶‚ÄúDoes the average Cambodian even know what a digital asset is?‚Äù‚ÄúBro, come on we got those DEFA negotiations going on.‚Äù‚ÄúYea but like‚Ä¶come on‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúDoes anyone?!

Why CRED needs to win the CBDC Race,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianstartups/comments/1igkn5v/why_cred_needs_to_win_the_cbdc_race/,r/indianstartups,2025-02-03T08:36:43.547000+0000,3,3,"‚û°Ô∏è UPI Apps Are Extremely Habit-FormingLet's forget CRED and CBDC for a moment and just think about how habit-forming UPI apps are. Think about the last time you changed your UPI app. A staggering 93% of the market is owned by just three players - PhonePe, Paytm and Google Pay. These apps pull out all the stops to reinforce this habit--reward programs, generous cashbacks--we've all been there.And the most astonishing thing, they do all of this and still make no money on any of the UPI transactions you make on them (they do make money in some cases, but I'm overlooking those for now).But why?‚û°Ô∏è Distribution Through UPI Is What Creates Successful SuperappsWell, it's because UPI transactions are a very powerful way for these superapps to gain distribution. Yes, they make no money on any of the transactions, but every other feature on the superapp is designed to generate revenue. That's the beauty of the distribution you get by being a dominant UPI player. Google Pay generates revenue through the instant gold loans that it provides; PhonePe generates revenue when you pay bills through it--you get the point.But none of this would be possible if they didn't have a lion's share of the UPI market.‚û°Ô∏è CBDC & UPI: Two sides of the same coinNow let's look at Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or E - Rupee which is simply a digitised form of the physical currency we have at the moment. But this is where things get interesting. The RBI has been pushing CBDC since 2022 as a complementary technology to UPI. It is being called the technology that will push us toward a ""less-cash economy"" and increase financial inclusion in the country.‚û°Ô∏è CRED Is the 5th Largest UPI Player With a Market Share of Less Than 1%CRED is currently the fifth largest UPI app on the market after Navi UPI overtook it on 18th November of last year. CRED finally has a chance to gain a UPI-like distribution by being early on CBDC. They realise the distribution upside that you get by being a dominant player. They need to win the CBDC race.---I've also written the same article in my weekly Substack newsletter - Saffron Stock, where every Sunday I explore the Indian fintech scene.

What are the ways to legally convert USDC to INR?,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1gg9qb9/what_are_the_ways_to_legally_convert_usdc_to_inr/,r/LegalAdviceIndia,2024-10-31T08:32:26.851000+0000,11,41,"Hi, so I'd been doing some freelancing work for a US-based startup called Outlier AI, which gives us payouts in either PayPal or AirTM. Now, PayPal requires a business account to receive payments so I had opted for AirTM. I received payouts in the form of USDC, but the issue is the conversion into INR.Now, there are 500 ways AirTM enables us to do so, but all of them seem fishy because they involve some form of Peer-to-Peer(P2P) activity. Is there no foolproof way to achieve this? I have no qualms at all about the taxes, just the conversion process.For reference, a payment method is listed as PhonePe, where you're connected to an ""AirTM verified cashier"" who sends the asked amount to your PhonePe through UPI, and when you confirm the received payment, AirTM deducts that amount from your account and passes it onto the cashier.Similar methods include P2P transfer to Indian Banks(NEFT), PayTM etc. There's a lucrative option of Amazon Gift card where someone purchases a gift card on your behalf and shares you the code so that you can add it to your account, but then, wouldn't it be a direct evasion of taxes?My ask is, what should be the steps now? Do I give up the amount I have in AirTM(with a heavy heart of course, but I can do that)? or is there any legal way to convert it into INR? or what?I'd appreciate if the solutions revolve around the current scenario, rather than asking me to opt for PayPal.

If the ID and cybercrime get that case then our OP will be involved too.2 Coming to your point about 100 crore plus Do you even know how money is laundered? Nobody makes a 100 crore transaction if they have 1000 crores they will make 10000 rupees multiple transaction.ED knows how to catch these transactions THAT IS WHY THEY GET CAUGHT DUH!Just like people were were depositing 49000 cash years ago got caught then they started depositing 45000 since ED was flagging 49000 cash deposits done without Pan Card.Then they started doing 35K but still are getting caught.I don\'t know why are you talking about white collar. These people selling USDT online are not white collared employees there is a huge nexus of these people who buy stolen USDT or crypto or take USDT as payment to launder money and instead of depositing it to their account they are waiting for someone to buy it. They think if they do that they will not be traced not true. Just like Banks even Binance has to give up the information of the transactions(like I said earlier they can\'t be held responsible because they are obliged to share details of any account holder if flagged by cybercrime/EDThese people are generally scammers not white collared workers.YEs exactly that is the issue the risk is great your account gets frozen and the worst part this is india so cybercrime and ED will harras you even if they know you are not involved you will have to take a lawyer to prove you innocense they are not bothered about being fair to you.The risk is too much.""PMLA, taxation compliance goes to sellers"" That is where he gets caught he deposites 10k worth money into his account and show it is from you(or OP) and after a year the ED finds a lot of suspiscious transactions and now thinks you are also invovled.It doesn\'t not happen immediately it takes time.The risk is too much it is not fear mongering if you want to buy USDT buy it from the exchangeThink about it yaar!! Who the hell holds USDT and sits? White collared workers? Sorry before you start arguing yes there are people who conver their crypto assets to USDT when their crypto is crashing or when USD is going up.

What Happens If You Send Crypto to the Wrong Wallet Network?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoindiap2p/comments/1l9eih2/what_happens_if_you_send_crypto_to_the_wrong/,r/cryptoindiap2p,2025-06-12T05:30:56.453000+0000,4,0,"This is one of the most common and painful mistakes people make. You‚Äôre trying to send something like USDT, and you select the wrong network. The transaction shows as successful, but the funds don‚Äôt show up in the receiver‚Äôs wallet.So what really happens when you do this? Can you recover your funds? Let‚Äôs look at all the possibilities, depending on where you sent the crypto.First, understand the core issue: same token, different networksTokens like USDT, USDC, or ETH can exist on multiple blockchains.Some common ones are:ERC20 (Ethereum)TRC20 (Tron)BEP20 (Binance Smart Chain)Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, etc.Even if the token name is the same, the underlying network determines how and where it travels. Sometimes, wallet addresses on different chains look identical, but they are not compatible across networks.This is like sending a parcel to the right apartment number on the wrong street. It gets delivered somewhere, but not where it was supposed to go.Scenario 1: You sent it to a centralized exchange (Binance, CoinDCX, Bitget, etc.)If you sent tokens using the wrong network to your wallet on an exchange, the transaction will likely be successful on the blockchain, but the funds will not appear in your account.For example, you send USDT using TRC20, but the deposit section of the exchange was set to ERC20. The money technically reaches the wallet address, but the exchange system doesn‚Äôt register it, because it only watches the ERC20 blockchain.Can it be recovered?Yes, many top exchanges offer token recovery for such cases, but:You need to raise a support ticketYou‚Äôll have to provide the transaction hash (TXID), address, token type, and networkIt might take time ‚Äî from a few days to a couple of weeksSome exchanges charge a recovery feeSome don‚Äôt offer recovery at all if the token or network is unsupportedWhat to do next:Raise a support ticket immediately with all the transaction details. The sooner you act, the higher the chance of recovery.Scenario 2: You sent it to a self-custody wallet (like Metamask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, etc.)This is a bit more hopeful if you control the seed phrase or private key of the wallet.Let‚Äôs say you sent TRC20 USDT to your Metamask wallet (which is built for Ethereum, not Tron). You won‚Äôt see the funds in Metamask because it doesn‚Äôt support the TRC20 network.However, because the address formats can match, and the private key remains the same, you can recover your funds by importing your Metamask wallet into a TRC20-compatible wallet, such as TronLink.Once you import the wallet using the seed phrase or private key, you‚Äôll see your TRC20 tokens there.What matters here is that you have full control of the wallet. If it‚Äôs a custodial wallet or app wallet where you don‚Äôt hold the keys, this option won‚Äôt work.Scenario 3: You sent it to a custodial wallet, Telegram bot wallet, or third-party appIn cases where you send tokens to a wallet controlled by a service (like a Telegram bot wallet, third-party trading app, or NFT marketplace), you often have no way to recover funds on your own.Even if the wallet address is yours, you don‚Äôt own the keys. That means you can‚Äôt import it into another wallet to access a different network.Your only option is to contact the platform‚Äôs support team. Some may offer recovery services. Many don‚Äôt.This is where most funds get stuck permanently if the service doesn‚Äôt support the network you used.How to avoid this mistakeAlways confirm the token and the network before making a transferIf you‚Äôre unsure, send a small test amount first (a few hundred rupees worth)Avoid rushing, especially if it‚Äôs your first time using a wallet or dealing with a new personUse wallets that clearly label the network and give warnings when switching chainsNever assume based on how the address looks ‚Äî Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon all use similar address formats, but the networks are differentWhere you sent itWrong network used?Can it be recovered?What to doExchange (Binance, etc.)YesSometimes (via support)Raise a support ticket with full detailsMetamask / Trust WalletYesYes, if you control the keysImport into compatible wallet (e.g., TronLink for TRC20)Custodial wallet / BotYesRarelyContact platform or support teamThis is an easy mistake to make, especially for beginners. If you‚Äôve done this before and managed to recover your funds, share your story in the comments  it might save someone else from losing money.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:51:25.988627,"['Informative', 'None', 'Explains crypto recovery options when sent to the wrong network, with advice to avoid mistakes.']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

It enables state surveillance and challenges the dollar‚Äôs global role.China is integrating the e-CNY into cross-border systems (e.g., Project mBridge) to reduce reliance on US-controlled financial networks like SWIFT.Global CBDC Race:Over 49 countries are piloting CBDCs, with India, Brazil, and the EU advancing rapidly. The US opposes a retail CBDC, favoring private-sector stablecoins instead.The Federal Reserve has halted CBDC development due to political backlash, focusing instead on dollar-backed stablecoins.Crypto Market Growth:The crypto market cap surged from $910 million in 2021 to $2.8 trillion in 2025, driven by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and DeFi growth.The US lags in crypto adoption but leads in mining (35% of global hash rate) after China‚Äôs 2021 mining ban.Strategic Implications:The US views crypto as critical for economic competitiveness, national security, and preserving the dollar‚Äôs ""exorbitant privilege"" (e.g., sanctions enforcement).China‚Äôs CBDC and stablecoin plans threaten to fragment the global financial system, reducing US control.Conclusion: The US and China are pursuing divergent paths‚Äîprivate-sector innovation (US) vs. state-controlled digital currency (China)‚Äîto shape the future of money.

The Bitcoin Crossroads: From Surveillance Tool to Sideline,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRPWorld/comments/1m5np22/the_bitcoin_crossroads_from_surveillance_tool_to/,r/XRPWorld,2025-07-21T16:33:27.908000+0000,3,0,"TLDR: Bitcoin began as an outsider and a symbol of freedom, but as 2025 unfolds, it finds itself completing the circle, legendary and influential, but now quietly blackballed by the new system. The future belongs to rails and assets built for the world as it is becoming, not as it once was.‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîI have been watching Bitcoin since the very beginning, back in 2009 when it was just an experiment with no market price and only a handful of curious cypherpunks, cryptographers, and dreamers mining coins on home computers. In those early days, Bitcoin was sold as the breakaway currency, a tool designed to operate outside government reach and centralized control. The promise was anonymity and freedom, and the only headlines came from a small corner of the internet. Over the years, I have seen Bitcoin transform from a digital oddity into the world‚Äôs most talked-about asset. As we step into 2025, Bitcoin stands at a crossroads and the signs pointing to change are unmistakably clear.Despite early myths of anonymity, Bitcoin‚Äôs public ledger became a powerful tool for law enforcement. Billions in dark money have been traced and seized thanks to its transparency. For a time, Bitcoin was a paradox, a way out of the banking system but also a permanent record for anyone with the keys to analyze it. Some even call it a Trojan horse for surveillance wrapped in the promise of decentralization.Now the financial system is evolving again and Bitcoin is no longer at the center of it.The new rails are being built for compliance by design. On July 14th, 2025, Fedwire, the heart of America‚Äôs financial infrastructure, switched fully to ISO 20022, ushering in a new global payments standard for regulated, trackable digital assets. On that single day, over $4.7 trillion moved across ISO-compliant rails in the United States alone. SWIFT now sees over 1.4 million ISO payment messages daily worldwide, with J.P. Morgan processing nearly a third of all cross-border ISO transactions. Across Europe, Asia, and the BRICS, the pivot is just as aggressive. Brazil‚Äôs Pix system has driven mass digital adoption and India‚Äôs CBDC pilots are laying new groundwork for instant payments. J.P. Morgan forecasts that over ninety percent of the world‚Äôs high-value payments will be ISO 20022-compliant by November 2025.Congress reinforced this shift with the GENIUS Act, mandating transparency and oversight for stablecoins while sidelining speculative shadow tokens. The next migration of value will happen on rails designed for utility, not hype.In this new era, utility means more than just being a store of value or a vehicle for speculation. It means an asset can move seamlessly across borders, support instant settlement, integrate with institutional payment systems, and comply with regulatory standards. Ripple‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity solution is already settling cross-border payments for major banks in seconds, bypassing the old correspondent banking web. Stablecoins like USDC are being used by fintechs for instant payroll and international remittance, all with compliance baked in. Assets such as XRP, XDC, HBAR, and USDC are emerging as infrastructure tokens, built not just for holding but for actually doing the work of global finance.Meanwhile, the United States government quietly liquidated over nine thousand Bitcoin this summer, with the United Kingdom also announcing plans to sell off five billion pounds in seized crypto. Bitcoin is no longer a strategic reserve but a budget line-item.In July, an $8.6 billion dormant Bitcoin wallet moved for the first time in fourteen years. Experts suspect a possible hack or private key compromise, raising hard questions about long-term security. This comes amid a surge in sophisticated cyberattacks, not just on crypto holders but also on major government institutions. CertiK and Reuters report nearly $2.5 billion was lost to 344 crypto hacks and scams in the first half of 2025 alone. Even the wrench attack has gone global, with real-world crimes, kidnappings, and extortion targeting crypto holders now reported everywhere.Some analysts have floated the possibility. Could this whale wallet breach be an early glimpse of quantum-level attacks, where next-generation computing begins to crack legacy cryptography sooner than expected? Most experts say true quantum threats are still five to ten years away, but if this incident were quantum-driven, it would signal a seismic shift in digital asset security. Regardless, even the oldest and most secure vaults in Bitcoin can be breached. Every new hack is a warning that the old assumptions are fading.This is why Bitcoin is being left behind and quietly blackballed from the new financial system. Maxis will say Bitcoin cannot be stopped. They are right, the protocol is resilient. But exclusion from regulated payment rails means the bulk of global liquidity, institutional capital, and legal commerce flows elsewhere. Bitcoin can exist, but if you cannot move it into the legal economy, its use shrinks to the margins. Unstoppable just becomes uninvited.Some argue that Bitcoin‚Äôs value is its lack of compliance or oversight. As governments and institutions define the rules of access, only compliant assets flow through the arteries of global finance. Freedom without access is just isolation.Bitcoin‚Äôs core protocol has not been hacked, but value is lost at the user level. New financial rails demand end-to-end, institutional-grade security and recourse. Code is law is being replaced with real-world protection.Quantum risk is not just about Bitcoin. Institutions and regulated rails are already preparing with quantum-resistant upgrades. Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature makes upgrades slow and difficult, leaving it vulnerable as threats emerge.Yes, Bitcoin has ETFs and market cycles. Regulatory standards now determine what assets can settle real-world transactions and move institutional value. As regulated rails become the norm, popularity matters less than compliance and integration.Some Maxis claim that being outside the system is the point. In reality, when the global system blackballs an asset, it means less liquidity, less protection, and greater legal risk. Isolation brings irrelevance.Historically, value dictated rails. Now, rails dictate value. Governments are not just reacting. They are proactively building the financial pipes of the future. Bitcoin‚Äôs value will be forced to migrate or risk being stranded.It is easy to look at Bitcoin‚Äôs journey and see only code and markets, but beneath the surface, there is a powerful emotional attachment. For many retail investors, Bitcoin represents hope, rebellion, and an identity forged in online forums and meme culture. The memes, the diamond hands, and the tribal loyalty run deep. Even as the rails change and institutions move on, there will always be those who refuse to let go of the dream, even when the system itself has quietly moved on.Short term, speculation and market cycles still rule. The long game is about rails that institutions and governments can actually use, settle, and audit. Operational resiliency, efficient processing, and better sanctions screening are now table stakes.If you are retail, this is not a call to panic. It is a call to pay attention. The era of ideology and memes is giving way to a system where access and compliance define value. Do not get caught off guard thinking the old ways will protect you in a world built on utility, auditability, and global alignment.Direct quotes from industry leaders echo the new direction. As SWIFT‚Äôs head of strategy recently put it, ISO 20022 is not just a messaging upgrade, it is the blueprint for the next generation of global finance. Ripple‚Äôs Brad Garlinghouse has said, It‚Äôs about interoperability, not tribalism. The rails are opening, and only assets that can move with confidence will matter.Ignore the noise. Watch the rails. The next migration of value is not about narrative or scarcity. It is about who has access, who is compliant, and who can actually move money on the new global system.Bitcoin has come full circle, from its origins as a curiosity mined by a few idealists, to a global phenomenon, to a tool quietly monitored and now increasingly sidelined by the very system it once aimed to disrupt. Maybe the ride that started in a handful of obscure forums really is winding down. As the world builds new financial rails around compliance, transparency, and institutional power, the role of Bitcoin is shifting. No longer the future, but a remarkable chapter in how we got here.What comes next is not about nostalgia, but about who adapts and who moves with the new current. Maybe it is time to see that some rides are legendary for the distance they covered, not because they last forever.Figures like Michael Saylor have become household names in the Bitcoin world, loudly proclaiming Bitcoin as the end-all, be-all of currency. Saylor‚Äôs conviction is legendary. He speaks of Bitcoin as digital gold, the ultimate reserve, and the only true safe haven in a world of collapsing fiat. But it is worth noting that Saylor, for all his enthusiasm and media presence, is a relative newcomer to the game. He entered the space in 2020, long after Bitcoin had weathered its formative storms, regulatory crackdowns, and cycles of collapse and rebirth. For early adopters and those who witnessed Bitcoin‚Äôs arc from zero to hero, there is an understanding that narratives shift as systems evolve. While Saylor‚Äôs vision has brought new energy and institutional interest, it sometimes misses how the rails themselves are changing beneath the surface. Bitcoin‚Äôs greatest supporters today often celebrate the myth more than the messy reality. The game is not frozen in time, and the rules are being rewritten in real time.From Silk Road and Mt. Gox to the 2021 China mining ban and the ongoing FTX saga, Bitcoin has survived more existential threats and headlines than any asset in history. Each crisis also forged its myth, and each comeback fueled a deeper loyalty. This time, the challenge is not a headline or a hack. It is the silent rewriting of the world‚Äôs financial plumbing, and that is a different kind of test.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:52:01.231948,"['Negative', 'None', ""Bitcoin's relevance is declining as new, compliant financial systems take over.""]","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

The move is part of Beijing‚Äôs long-term vision to promote a ‚Äúmultipolar‚Äù currency system, reducing reliance on dominant Western currencies such as the dollar and euro.‚ÄúTraditional cross-border payment infrastructures can be easily politicized and weaponized,‚Äù Pan said, referencing growing concerns over geopolitical tensions and unilateral sanctions. He argued that digital technologies like CBDCs could offer countries more neutral financial tools for international commerce.The pledge comes amid heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S., as the Trump administration continues to impose tariffs that have spurred global market unease. China's push to expand the digital yuan is widely seen as a strategic effort to mitigate dependence on the dollar and enhance the country‚Äôs influence in global trade settlements.While stablecoins like USDT and USDC remain popular for cross-border crypto payments, they remain largely tied to the dollar. In contrast, the digital yuan offers an alternative controlled entirely by China‚Äôs central bank, appealing to countries and regions wary of U.S. financial leverage.China began developing the digital yuan in 2014 and has steadily scaled domestic trials. Its new global ambitions follow in the footsteps of other digital currency projects ‚Äî including the EU‚Äôs digital euro and the UAE‚Äôs digital dirham ‚Äî as central banks race to modernize payment systems.Still, international adoption remains a challenge. A February 2025 survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum showed that nearly one-third of central banks have slowed CBDC rollout plans, citing regulatory and economic uncertainties.China, however, appears undeterred ‚Äî pressing ahead in a digital currency arms race that could reshape the global financial landscape.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:52:06.674524,"['Neutral', 'None', ""China aims to expand its digital yuan globally, challenging the dollar's dominance in finance.""]","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

By 2025, over 100 countries are deep in pilots or development.

‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs no law or public referendum authorizing them‚Äîthe projects are being executed by technocrats and bureaucrats. Consultations happen, but they‚Äôre low-profile, highly technical, and non-binding.

‚Ä¢	These systems are fully traceable and programmable‚Äîmeaning central banks or governments could track every transaction, impose spending restrictions, or freeze accounts.

‚Ä¢	Only a few places (Bahamas, Nigeria, China) have rolled out live versions, mostly aimed at businesses‚Äînot individuals.

Let me take a crack at it.RippleNet (the payment network) can absolutely be used without XRP. It‚Äôs the messaging system, kind of like Swift but faster and more modern. But that‚Äôs not the full story.The part where XRP comes in is On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). That‚Äôs Ripple‚Äôs product that uses XRP as a bridge asset to instantly move value between two currencies. So instead of Bank A holding accounts with money sitting all over the world (called nostro/vostro accounts), they can just convert into XRP, send it in seconds, and convert out, all without pre-funding anything. That‚Äôs a big deal, especially for smaller banks and corridors where liquidity is expensive or hard to access.The key value prop of XRP is this: it settles value, not just sends messages. Chainlink, Swift‚Äôs upgrades, or even stablecoins may help move the message or represent a claim, but XRP actually settles the value on-chain, quickly, and without middlemen.Banks and payment companies like SBI, Tranglo, Pyypl, and others are already doing this in real life. Billions have moved through ODL and that‚Äôs actual usage, not speculation or hype.So, to answer your question: yes, a bridge currency is absolutely needed to solve real-world issues in cross-border finance.

I took alot of time reading over this post and all the comments and here are my thoughts.Maybe the vast majority of cross border payments is out of reach for XRP, but I'll attempt to answer this because I believe there's still several advantages for XRP.XRP will be better for more ill-liquid currency pairs and payment corridors. Obviously stablecoins make sense for something like USD to Euro for example, but it isn't as niche as you make it out to be. Not only are payment corridors in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa are great examples of this, but from my research it's still cheaper for payments to countries like Japan and India to use XRP instead of stablecoins, and those countries still do huge business in remittances. So maybe it's not going to be the digital world's reserve currency that handles 100 percent of cross border payments, but it could be a valuable FX liquidity tool that handles maybe 10 percent of those transactions? I think that's possible.XRP doesn't require prefunding of accounts, while stablecoins do. One huge advantage with XRP is that you don't need billions and billions of dollars in different denominations of currency locked away in foreign bank accounts to facilitate cross border transactions. Meanwhile, stablecoins require 1:1 backing, which again meaning locking up large amounts of capital to facilitate these transactions. XRP has the advantage in payments where the sender doesn't want to pre fund accounts, or for institutions who want to free up capital.XRP has utility for the settlement of transactions of tokenized RWAs and digital securities, equities, and derivatives. XRP has potential to be a great settlement asset for RWAs on chain like real estate, like how they participated in a Hong Kong Monetary Authority's CBDC pilothttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/ripple-joins-hong-kong-cbdc-045735933.htmlXRP has huge potential for the settlement of digital securities, as lined out being explicitly mentioned in an official DTCC patent:https://cryptonews.net/news/altcoins/30985005/?utm_source=chatgpt.comThis use case honestly might end up being much much more fruitful than replacing SWIFT would've been. We're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars worth of value that could be up for grabs.Ultimately I think we're heading into a multi chain world where various blockchains are going to serve their own purposes in digital finance.

Their mission? Test how tokenized money‚Äîlike e-HKD and tokenized deposits‚Äîcan power faster, safer cross-border settlements.One standout use case focuses on Australian investors using digital dollars to buy tokenized money market funds (MMFs) from Hong Kong. The process is designed to be near real-time, helping cut counterparty risks in global fund flows.üîÅ How it works:Investors first convert AUD to A$DC (a stablecoin), then swap it for e-HKD via Chainlink CCIP, and use that to purchase tokenized fund units in Hong Kong. Another variant uses tokenized HKD deposits minted on Ethereum Sepolia. Both flows are automated, compliant, and programmable.üëâ Key insights from the pilot so far:üîπ Two types of tokenized money are being tested:Central bank-issued e-HKD and bank-issued tokenized deposits, each with different issuance, reserve management, and infrastructure needs.üîπ Smart contract standards differ:e-HKD uses ERC-20, favored for its simplicity and wide adoption. Tokenized deposits use ERC-3643, designed for compliance, with built-in KYC/AML and transfer restrictions.üîπ Cross-chain tech unlocks interoperability:Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP bridges ANZ‚Äôs private DASchain with the public Ethereum network, enabling seamless movement of digital assets across ecosystems with strong security guarantees.üîπ Hybrid blockchain setup:Private chains offer control and privacy, while public chains deliver accessibility and broader interoperability. This pilot tests both to understand trade-offs in security, scalability, and compliance.This marks a meaningful step forward in real-world experimentation with programmable money‚Äîtesting not just speed, but also identity, compliance, FX handling, and settlement across jurisdictions.As more financial institutions get involved, this kind of tokenized architecture could underpin the next wave of global finance.Source Visa","{'comment_id': 't1_myzvoaz', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/fintech/comments/1lgsha9/comment/myzvoaz/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'Can someone prepare a MyFin account?

Accenture x DTCC ‚Äì Possible Hedera connections,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1kxkdp6/accenture_x_dtcc_possible_hedera_connections/,r/Hedera,2025-05-28T15:42:43.406000+0000,80,13,"I have been trying to piece together the different facets of Accenture's partnership with DTCC. Considering the global behemoth that Accenture is, it is not surprising to see that they are associated with multiple projects and are knee-deep involved in various CBDC projects across regions. I will focus my post on Accenture's known collaborations with DTCC.DTCC‚Äôs whitepaper with Accenture on how to govern DLT networksBack in 2019, DTCC and Accenture released a whitepaper that envisioned a governance model to manage the risks and consequences of a distributed ledger landscape. While I recommend going through the paper to fully understand the details, I am referencing a key section below to set the context on how DTCC expects DLT governance to play out.Link to WhitepaperFrom the whitepaper:Our DLT network operating model aligns to existing frameworks and is reliant on three key roles:The Governing Entityrepresents and is accountable to the interests of the entirety of the network as a priority, with an expectation of complete integrity and continuous reliable operation. The governing entity owns responsibility and accountability for creating the policies, rules of conduct, operating procedures, controls, standards and so on, to establish a shared platform that benefits all members fairly.The Network Operatoris charged with operating the DLT network fairly and objectively for the benefit of all members in accordance with the policies and procedures of the governing entity. This role ensures operational safety and soundness of the network.The members of the network communityinclude direct and indirect network participants and other third parties with interests in the network. Examples include transactional participants, data providers and consumers, regulators, industry associations, software vendors, and so on. Each member of the network has a primary responsibility to their own shareholders and owners.Accenture x Digital Dollar ProjectThe Digital Dollar Project (DDP) is a partnership between the Digital Dollar Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, and Accenture to advance the exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC)‚Äîor a ‚Äúdigital dollar.‚ÄùIn May 2020, the DDP published a white paper describing a champion model of a U.S. CBDC. As part of their research initiatives, the DDP launched a series of pilot programs exploring potential uses for a U.S. CBDC or ‚Äúdigital dollar‚Äù.Accenture agreed to fund five of the DDP‚Äôs CBDC pilot programs.Subsequently in 2021, DTCC joined the Digital Dollar Project to launch the first pilot in the program.DTCC‚Äôspilotleveraged DLT, with the goal of demonstrating success in settling tokenized securities on DTCC‚Äôs Digital Settlement Network prototype against tokenized dollars on asimulated CBDC network provided by Accenture.Accenture is pleased to have supported DTCC and DDP in their efforts to explore the value of digital currency and tokenization in the evolution of our capital markets.- David Treat, Senior Managing Director and Global Metaverse Co-lead at Accenture.This is the same David Treat from the below exchange onLinkedInwherein Brett, who's held the role of Chair of the Hedera Council previously, commented.Accenture and Hedera - CBDC LinksAccenture alsoparticipatedin Sweden‚Äôs CBDC project for e-Krona. We know that Hedera (along with Algorand) wasinvolvedin a project with the Sweden‚Äôs central bank related to the CBDC.In September 2024, Accentureinvestedin Emtech, a CBDC-focused startup building on Hedera. EMTECHjoinedthe Technical Sandbox Program of the Digital Dollar Project in 2022.Other Accenture CBDC partnerships:Earlier this year, Digital Euro Associationjoinsforces with Accenture. DEA has apartnershipwith The Hedera Foundation as well. Accenture recently was listed as one of the 70 participants involved in ECB‚ÄôsInnovation Hubsigning up to work with the ECB to explore the central bank digital currency's payment functionalities and use cases.Accenture's Thomas Hawkins is on theBoardof the Digital Pound Foundation. Both Accenture and Hedera are members of the foundation and the Digital Pound's social media often reposts new updates by Hedera.In addition to the above, Accenture has publicly worked with the Bank of Canada as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore on their CBDC projects.Accenture and DTCC - AI HackathonAnnouncement PostDTCC hosted an AI Hackathon in February this year. DTCC‚Äôs inaugural Hackathon, Innovate.DTCC, in partnership with FINOS and Broadridge with 250+ participants, 35 teams, and 46 organizations across the financial services ecosystem‚Äîincluding banks, software providers, and students from top universities.Accenture won theVendor/ Software Provider Overall Award for Automated Regulatory ComplianceDTCC's LinkedIn Post included mentions of a few companies who are publicly associated with Hedera -ioBuilders - who also partnered with Hedera to develop the Asset Tokenization Studio) [source]IntellectEU - known system integrator of the Hedera network [sourceAndrew Aitken, who was previously the Chief Open Source Officer at Hedera was one of the 12 Judges.Other Key Details:Accenture, Hedera, and DTCC (along with Hitachi) were founding premier members of the LF Decentralized Trust when it waslaunchedlast year. Although Accenture has since then moved out of the ‚ÄúPremier Member‚Äù list, it continues to be a general member of the association and is also represented on the Board of the LFDT.Shyam Nagarajan, current COO of Hedera is on the Governing Board of LF Decentralized Trust along with representatives from Hitachi, Mastercard, Accenture, Kaleido, and DTCC.Earlier last year, in February, EQTY Labs and Accentureannounceda possible integration with EQTY Lab‚Äôs AI Integrity Suite. We know Accentureparticipatedin a panel discussion with Hedera and EQTY Lab at Davos 2025 this year. Topic of the Panel: The Future of AI: Advancing Decentralized TechnologiesDeepak Lalan who was a managing director at Accenture India is now the Regional Director for APAG region at The Hashgraph Association.

Cashless society is right here...and Trump's the man of the hour,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1l9xnha/cashless_society_is_right_hereand_trumps_the_man/,r/conspiracy,2025-06-12T20:54:46.499000+0000,3,44,"We've had inflation destroy the economy, and now Trump's tariffs are on everything. He then wants DOGE to ""cut spending."" Yet if we shrunk inflation but kept with the tariffs, we'd have less money in circulation, but it would still be expensive to buy things. He would crush the U.S. dollar.It's no secret that he loves crypto. He scams his fans with it, hypes it up among other things. They'll create a digital currency (CBDC) and Trump will hype it up as the dollar gets destroyed.He really is turning this place into China. He's so jealous of China....of the fact that they are the manufacturing superpower, and of the tight grip they have on their people. Trump wants their dictatorship here so bad, it's unreal.We are not allowed criticize Israel, he's deporting migrant workers because he wants us working in the factories, using tariffs to reset global trade so WE ARE THE SERVANTS (trade war is pointless against China, i.e. slave labor.)He's getting rid of due process/ courts, so they can deport whoever and whatever....among other things, he'll cut programs for people to keep us starving; but beef up law enforcement for whats to come....oh yeah he teamed up with Palantir to create a database keeping track of every American and make an AI surveillance state ran by Sam Altman or something, and we'll have Elonmusk and his Starlink team up with ""The Big Dome"" to have eyes in the sky 24/7....very China.RFK (who MAY be compromised) is creating the Autism registry database, and while best case scenario, it's for what it says....idk about that. It break's HIPPA law to view everyone's records, which is UNPRECEDENTED, and it wouldn't surprise me if they sell that info to the highest bidder out there.War with Iran may just be the the final catalyst to kick off martial law and food rations or whatever else may come this way. There's so much more to say but not point anymore.I voted for Trump and I'm ashamed of myself for doing so. I should've known that it was too good to be true. He was never going to fight the deep state.If they wanted to kill him, they would've. If they wanted to imprison him, THEY WOULD'VE. The ""worlds richest man"" even brought his social media presence back from the grave for this takeover. Trump is just a way to give the American public a false sense of security. While him and his friends get richer and richer, we'll stay dirt poor and keep working, or get killed off in the next disaster.Even though Kamala wasn't good, she never would've had the hype, means, or honestly intelligence to pull this stuff off. I think that the establishment KNEW Trump would win, and were banking on that. I'm so sorry.TL;DR Trump is turning America into China in practically every way (he was always jealous of China's grip over the people), the powers that be knew that he would win, and planned accordingly. To all those hurt, I am so sorry for what we have done.","{'comment_id': 't1_mxg6kyh', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/conspiracy/comments/1l9xnha/comment/mxg6kyh/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': '[Meta] Sticky CommentRule 2does not applywhen replying to this stickied comment.Rule 2does applythroughout the rest of this thread.What this means: Please keep any ""meta"" discussion directed at specific users, mods, orr/conspiracyin general in this comment chainonly.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The Flippening That Matters,https://www.reddit.com/r/XRPWorld/comments/1l74cjl/the_flippening_that_matters/,r/XRPWorld,2025-06-09T13:07:51.418000+0000,2,0,"Most people in crypto are watching the wrong battle. They‚Äôre tracking market caps, comparing coins, waiting for Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin as if that is the moment everything changes. But that flippening, the one people tweet about, is just a distraction. The real transformation is already quietly unfolding beneath the headlines. XRP isn‚Äôt trying to flip Bitcoin. It‚Äôs targeting something far more powerful and entrenched. It‚Äôs challenging the foundation of liquidity control itself, and at the top of that foundation sits BlackRock.BlackRock doesn‚Äôt operate like the crypto world does. It doesn‚Äôt chase volatility or play to public sentiment. It moves in silence, through complex networks of custody, risk, and institutional flow. Its internal engine, Aladdin, routes more capital than most sovereign nations. It decides how liquidity moves between governments, banks, pensions, and hedge funds. BlackRock isn‚Äôt just an asset manager. It‚Äôs a shadow central bank. And it maintains its dominance by controlling how money moves, not just where it ends up.XRP wasn‚Äôt built to compete in a price race. It wasn‚Äôt designed to win popularity contests on exchanges or chase speculative mania. It was engineered specifically for infrastructure, as a bridge, as a corridor, as the invisible layer connecting ledgers that don‚Äôt speak the same language. Ripple understood something fundamental from the start. The real power isn‚Äôt in the assets themselves. It‚Äôs in the plumbing. XRP was built to become the plumbing.While Bitcoin clings to its narrative as digital gold, XRP operates more like a circuit, programmable, liquid, instantaneous. Where BlackRock relies on broker-dealers, custodians, and delayed settlement, XRP executes cross-border flows with atomic finality, typically settling transactions in three to five seconds. RippleNet removes Nostro and Vostro friction, reducing settlement costs by up to 40%, replacing these legacy layers with a global liquidity mesh. What used to take days and multiple layers of trust now happens in real-time, without needing permission.That is the difference. BlackRock wraps control in synthetic exposure through ETFs, indexes, and managed baskets. Ripple unwraps direct access. It bypasses the need for middlemen by connecting endpoints directly. It doesn‚Äôt mirror markets. It settles them. And that‚Äôs why this flippening matters. It‚Äôs not about whether XRP overtakes Bitcoin on a chart. It‚Äôs about whether the world recognizes that settlement, not speculation, is the true foundation of control.Banks aren‚Äôt joining RippleNet because they want to be part of a crypto trend. They‚Äôre joining because they need liquidity that moves like information. On-Demand Liquidity isn‚Äôt a meme. It‚Äôs a function. Major institutions like SBI Remit in Japan and Tranglo across Southeast Asia are already using XRP for treasury flows, FX corridors, and bridging local currencies previously unsupported by traditional banking networks. These aren‚Äôt retail plays. They‚Äôre system-level shifts with proven real-world utility.And as this unfolds, BlackRock watches quietly. It doesn‚Äôt need to directly own XRP to benefit from its rise. Its growing connections, such as the Coinbase Custody integration, BIS-led tokenization pilots, and deep custodial relationships, aren‚Äôt accidental. These represent carefully layered exposure, quietly preparing for a world where decentralized liquidity becomes a standard rather than an alternative. BlackRock‚Äôs recent initiatives around digital custody strongly indicate strategic positioning rather than coincidence. The strategy is clear: gain access without declaration, build influence without risk, enter late but dominate.There‚Äôs no need for a press release. Influence works better without headlines.Beneath this quiet observation, another critical layer is forming. Central banks are beginning pilot programs for digital currencies. They know they can‚Äôt route CBDCs through Bitcoin. Ethereum is too congested, too fragmented. They need compliance, finality, and liquidity bridges that can‚Äôt be politicized. Bhutan‚Äôs Ripple-backed CBDC pilot isn‚Äôt merely a demonstration‚Äîit positions Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure strategically within Asia‚Äôs emerging digital finance ecosystem. Similarly, Palau‚Äôs XRPL stablecoin pilot serves as a precedent-setting gateway for liquidity across Pacific corridors, embedding Ripple‚Äôs settlement protocol into future central bank transactions.These aren‚Äôt random experiments. They‚Äôre strategic footholds. Ripple is becoming the connective tissue of state-level value exchange, quietly, without fanfare, exactly as intended.It‚Äôs true the United States regulatory landscape for XRP remains unsettled due to Ripple‚Äôs ongoing litigation with the SEC. But Ripple has proactively engaged regulators globally‚Äîin the UK, UAE, Japan, Singapore, and elsewhere‚Äîto secure compliance and clarity well beyond U.S. borders. Rather than a barrier, Ripple‚Äôs global regulatory approach positions it uniquely, potentially creating a future scenario where XRP‚Äôs regulatory uncertainty in one jurisdiction becomes irrelevant amid widespread international acceptance.When CBDCs go live, they won‚Äôt announce how they interoperate. But they will need to. Ripple‚Äôs proactive global regulatory outreach and proven infrastructure uniquely position XRP for seamless integration at the highest levels of finance. Ripple‚Äôs technology already quietly underpins multiple central bank testbeds. In this way, the real flippening becomes inevitable‚Äînot because the world explicitly chooses XRP, but because it will be the only viable option when traditional trust breaks down and instantaneous liquidity becomes mandatory.The flippening people anticipate is flashy, but the one that truly matters is subtle. XRP isn‚Äôt trying to become number one on CoinMarketCap. It‚Äôs embedding itself in the financial rails beneath the market. When this flip occurs, there won‚Äôt be a dramatic price spike or televised announcement. Instead, there will simply be a shift in control, from legacy institutions hoarding liquidity to decentralized protocols that allow it to flow freely.This isn‚Äôt about retail victory. It‚Äôs about who programs the infrastructure of the future. XRP is already being used, already routing value, already becoming the fallback when the old system stalls.By the time the world realizes what‚Äôs changed, XRP may already be impossible to uproot.It moves through those who are ready. The question is, are you positioned to move with it? ‚ÄîThe Bridge Watcher‚∏ªTLDR: This piece reframes XRP‚Äôs true purpose and target. While most observers fixate on speculative market cap battles, XRP is quietly challenging the deeper systems, specifically BlackRock‚Äôs control over liquidity via platforms like Aladdin. XRP isn‚Äôt about speculation; it‚Äôs a settlement layer already utilized by institutions and tested by central banks. Despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S., Ripple‚Äôs proactive global regulatory engagement positions XRP strongly. The real flippening won‚Äôt be visible in charts; it will happen beneath them, reshaping control over liquidity flows.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:52:17.465392,"['Hopeful', 'None', 'XRP is poised to revolutionize liquidity, challenging BlackRock and traditional finance through infrastructure.']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

While MiCA aims to provide oversight and investor protection, Panetta said its impact has been limited‚Äîespecially in promoting compliant stablecoin adoption within the bloc.‚ÄúWe would be remiss to think that the evolution of crypto-assets can be controlled only through rules and restrictions,‚Äù Panetta stated.MiCA‚Äôs Modest ImpactPanetta noted that since MiCA‚Äôs rollout in late 2024, only a small number of electronic money tokens (EMTs) have been issued in the EU, with little uptake from Italy‚Äôs regulated financial intermediaries. Most activity, he said, has been concentrated in custodial and trading services‚Äînot stablecoin issuance.‚ÄúIn Italy, there has so far been little interest in the issuance of crypto-assets by supervised intermediaries,‚Äù Panetta said.Cross-Border Risks RemainDespite MiCA‚Äôs efforts to standardize crypto regulation, Panetta warned that EU investors remain vulnerable to failures of foreign-based platforms, where regulatory protections may be weaker or absent.He urged the European Union to lead efforts in crafting global crypto standards, stressing the importance of international coordination to protect financial stability.Digital Euro: The Missing PiecePanetta argued that the digital euro, backed by the central bank, is essential to providing a secure, efficient, and accessible payment system. Unlike private stablecoins, the digital euro would retain public trust and support the central bank‚Äôs role in the modern financial system.‚ÄúThe digital euro project stems precisely from this need,‚Äù Panetta concluded.His stance aligns with ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone, who has pushed for the CBDC amid rising use of dollar-denominated stablecoins‚Äîwhich now account for 97% of global stablecoin volume.Meanwhile, Tether, issuer of the leading stablecoin USDT, recently declined MiCA registration, with CEO Paolo Ardoino calling the regulation ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù for smaller European banks.Panetta‚Äôs remarks highlight the intensifying debate over how best to regulate crypto in Europe‚Äîand whether state-backed digital money will be the ultimate safeguard.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:52:19.804650,"['Neutral', 'None', 'Bank of Italy chief says digital euro is key to managing crypto risks, not just MiCA.']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

Global trust is at an all-time low, and financial systems become siloed, politicized, and fragmented.In this context, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition becomes more obvious than ever. It‚Äôs a neutral, decentralized, and borderless financial layer that no government controls ‚Äî and everyone can access.Why Bitcoin thrives in this world:Neutral settlement layer: Unlike USD or a digital yuan, Bitcoin isn't owned or weaponized by any state. This makes it the only acceptable bridge across rival blocs.Censorship resistance: No one can block, freeze, or reverse Bitcoin transactions ‚Äî critical in a world full of sanctions, capital controls, and political instability.Monetary sovereignty: Anyone ‚Äî individuals, small nations, stateless communities ‚Äî can use Bitcoin to protect wealth and settle trade outside the legacy system.Open, permissionless infrastructure: Bitcoin is global by design. Lightning Network makes it usable for high-speed commerce even in low-trust zones.Why CBDCs must fail (especially globally):CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) are being pushed hard, but they are fundamentally incompatible with a free, multipolar global economy.Not neutral: Every CBDC is a national project. No rival nation will trust another country‚Äôs digital currency for global trade or reserves.Surveillance by design: Governments can monitor, freeze, or program how CBDC money is used. It‚Äôs programmable obedience ‚Äî not freedom.Capital control tools: CBDCs reinforce walls ‚Äî they won‚Äôt move freely across borders, especially between hostile blocs.Still fiat: Inflation, debt monetization, and political manipulation all still apply. Digital does not mean sound.TLDR:Bitcoin is the only truly neutral, censorship-resistant financial protocol in existence. In a world of fractured alliances and centralized control, Bitcoin becomes the digital common ground. CBDCs, on the other hand, are just digital cages ‚Äî they‚Äôll accelerate fragmentation, not solve it.Would love to hear what you all think. Is this the direction the world is heading?

Let's delve into the key developments and what they mean for us as investors.U.S. Regulatory Landscape: Clarity Amidst ComplexityIn January 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14178, titled ""Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology."" This order prohibits the establishment of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and mandates the creation of a federal regulatory framework for digital assets within 180 days.Additionally, the IRS has finalized rules requiring brokers to track and report cryptocurrency transaction proceeds, simplifying tax reporting for investors.Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Bold MoveThe U.S. has established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, repurposing forfeited bitcoins from criminal and civil cases. This initiative underscores the government's commitment to integrating digital assets into the national financial strategy.Global Regulatory DevelopmentsEuropean Union:The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation became fully applicable in December 2024, providing a harmonized framework for crypto-assets across EU member states.United Kingdom:The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to ban retail investors from borrowing money to invest in cryptocurrencies, aiming to protect consumers and maintain market integrity.Key Takeaways for InvestorsStay Informed:Regulations are rapidly evolving. Regularly consult official sources and regulatory announcements to stay updated.Compliance is Crucial:Ensure that your investment activities align with current laws and reporting requirements to avoid legal complications.Diversify Wisely:While integrating digital assets into national strategies is promising, always assess the risks and diversify your portfolio accordingly.How do you perceive these regulatory changes impacting your investment strategies?Are these developments fostering a safer investment environment or stifling innovation?Looking forward to your insights and discussions.",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:52:26.641432,"['Neutral', 'Trump was not President in 2025.', 'Discusses potential 2025 crypto regulations and their impact on investors.']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

Engineered Discontent: Blueprint for a Technocratic World Order,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracytheories/comments/1kivdyn/engineered_discontent_blueprint_for_a/,r/conspiracytheories,2025-05-09T22:39:01.130000+0000,6,0,"The world we believe we inhabit, a dynamic, somewhat chaotic but ultimately organic interplay of sovereign nations, free markets, and democratic wills, is, I have come to understand, an increasingly elaborate illusion. Beneath this veneer, beyond the daily clamor of politics and the ebb and flow of markets, lies a deeper, more deliberate current: a multi-generational, multifaceted, and globally coordinated strategy aimed at the systematic dismantling of the existing world order (characterized by sovereign nation-states, traditional democratic processes, and organically evolved cultural norms) and the erection in its place of a unified, global technocratic superstate. This is not to invoke the simplistic, cartoonish cabal of shadowy figures meeting in smoke-filled rooms, but to identify a powerful and undeniable convergence of interests and a shared ideological framework among a transnational network of influential actors. These actors, operating across the commanding heights of global finance, multinational corporations, supranational organizations, academic institutions, and policy-shaping bodies, consistently advance, though not always acting under a single, rigid command, policies, narratives, and technological deployments that inexorably trend towards technocratic centralization, global governance, and a technologically managed re-engineering of human society itself.My initial analytical framework, the Engineered Discontent Hypothesis, posited that the pervasive societal disillusionment, the escalating crises, and the erosion of trust in traditional institutions are not merely spontaneous occurrences. Instead, it argued that these conditions are, to a significant degree, significantly influenced, opportunistically leveraged, and in some cases, arguably even cultivated, to create a strategically exploitable environment of institutional failure and pervasive crisis. This meticulously cultivated atmosphere of chaos, fear, and distrust is designed to make populations weary, fearful, and ultimately receptive, even desperate, for radical, pre-planned ""solutions."" These solutions invariably involve ceding more power to centralized, often unelected, global bodies and accepting unprecedented levels of technological surveillance and control over every facet of human life. The 2030 timeline, so prominently featured in globalist roadmaps such as the UN's Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, appears to serve as a crucial intermediate marker for the solidification of foundational elements of this new global order: notably, a centralized global (or interoperable) digital currency system, integrated digital identity for all, and a panoptic global governance framework capable of enforcing new global norms.Since first articulating that hypothesis, further deep-dive research, encompassing the official publications and often candid pronouncements of international bodies, the meticulous and courageous work of independent researchers and scholars who dare to challenge the established consensus (and often face severe professional and personal repercussions for doing so), and the strategic communications and counter-narratives emanating from nations like Russia that are actively resisting aspects of the unipolar, globalist agenda, has only served to deepen, broaden, and refine this understanding. The picture that emerges is one of a complex, adaptive, and astonishingly ambitious project to reshape the very fabric of human existence, a project whose roots run deep into history but whose technological capabilities are unprecedented.I. The Architects of a New Global Epoch: A Deeper Anatomy of the Converging Elite Network and Their Ideological UnderpinningsTo fully comprehend the forces at play, it is essential to dissect the nature of this ""network of convergence"" of elite power. It is not a monolith, but a complex ecosystem of influence, with identifiable nodes that consistently reinforce each other, often operating under the shared banner of ""global solutions for global problems.""The Financial Nexus: The Apex Predators of Global Capital:The historical lineage and enduring power of certain interconnected financial dynasties (names like Rothschild and Rockefeller are consistently cited in critical analyses of global power structures, and for good reason) remain a foundational element. Their influence stretches back centuries, built on the control of banking, credit creation, and the financing of nations and international endeavors. Carroll Quigley, an esteemed historian at Georgetown University with access to elite circles and their documents, provided a stark and detailed account in his 1966 magnum opus, ""Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time."" Quigley wrote, with an insider's dispassion, of the long-term ambition of international bankers to ""create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole."" He further elaborated that this system was to be ""controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences."" This is not the speculation of a ""conspiracy theorist,"" but the detailed historical analysis of an insider.This ambition finds its modern institutional expression in entities like the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), located in Basel, Switzerland. Often the ""central bank of central banks"" called, the BIS operates with extraordinary autonomy, effectively beyond the direct jurisdiction or oversight of any single nation-state. It serves as a crucial coordinating body for global monetary policy and is, significantly, at the forefront of designing the architecture and promoting the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The statements from BIS officials regarding CBDCs are remarkably candid about their control potential. Agust√≠n Carstens, General Manager of the BIS, famously stated at an IMF seminar in October 2020, when discussing the difference between cash and CBDCs: ""We don't know who's using a $100 bill today and we don't know who's using a 1,000 peso bill today. The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that."" This explicit admission of seeking ""absolute control"" over the population's money is a chilling revelation of intent, one that goes far beyond mere payment efficiency.The critique of this concentrated financial power is not confined to Western independent researchers. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in numerous public addresses and policy statements, has frequently decried the dominance of a unipolar world order driven by what he and other Russian officials often term a ""golden billion"" (referring to the wealthy populations of Western nations) and their exploitative financial instruments. In his address at the Valdai Discussion Club on October 27, 2022, Putin asserted that the West, having ""printed trillions of dollars and euros,"" was effectively ""siphoning off goods from global markets, 'vacuuming them up,' so to speak,"" thereby exacerbating global economic imbalances and perpetuating a neocolonial financial system. This perspective, often amplified through Russian state media outlets like RT and Sputnik, while undoubtedly serving Russia's geopolitical interests, aligns with the broader concern articulated in my hypothesis: that a select financial elite manipulates global economic conditions to consolidate its power and control, often at the expense of sovereign nations and the well-being of ordinary people.The Transnational Corporate Imperium: Shapers of Policy and Society:The power wielded by multinational corporations has reached an unprecedented scale, often that of many nation-states surpassing. Key sectors are particularly influential in shaping our world and promoting the globalist agenda:Big Tech (Google/Alphabet, Apple, Meta/Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.):These entities are no longer mere providers of technological services; they are the architects of our digital reality, the gatekeepers of global information flows, and unparalleled harvesters of personal data. Their algorithms curate what a vast majority of the global population sees, reads, and believes, giving them immense power to shape public opinion and social norms. The Twitter Files, meticulously reported by independent journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and Michael Shellenberger in late 2022 and early 2023, provided irrefutable documentary evidence of a deep, pervasive, and routine collaboration between Twitter (now X) and a constellation of US government agencies, including the FBI, DHS, DOD, CIA, and the State Department, to actively censor specific narratives, individuals (including recognized scientists and journalists), and even humorous or satirical content that challenged official positions on highly controversial topics such as COVID-19 (vaccine safety, lockdown effectiveness, alternative treatments), the war in Ukraine, and election integrity. This documented collusion is a striking example of the ""public-private partnerships"" so often praised by institutions like the World Economic Forum, and which effectively create a system of state-corporate censorship that bypasses traditional constitutional limitations on government power.Big Pharma (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, etc.): The COVID-19 pandemic catapulted the pharmaceutical industry to a position of extraordinary global power and profitability. Companies like Pfizer and Moderna, whose mRNA vaccines were developed with substantial public funding (e.g., through Operation Warp Speed in the US and similar initiatives elsewhere), reaped tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars in profit, while benefiting from unprecedented liability shields granted by governments worldwide. This indemnification from legal responsibility for vaccine-related harm is a crucial point often overlooked. The intricate web of financial ties between these companies, regulatory agencies (such as the FDA in the US, the EMA in Europe, and the MHRA in the UK, which are responsible for approving their products), influential medical journals (which publish industry-funded research and often have editors with financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry), academic institutions (which conduct industry-sponsored clinical trials), and mainstream media (which are heavily dependent on pharmaceutical advertising revenue, a multi-billion dollar annual expenditure) has been meticulously documented by critics such as Dr. Peter G√∏tzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration and author of ""Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How Big Pharma Has Corrupted Healthcare."" (2013). The Danish physician G√∏tzsche states therein: ""Our medicines kill hundreds of thousands of people every year, and yet we continue to use them, often for conditions that are not serious. This is because the pharmaceutical industry has bribed and misled us."" This kind of critique, though controversial, points to deep systemic problems and conflicts of interest that can undermine public health.Big Energy & Agribusiness:Traditional fossil-fuel giants, but increasingly the ""Green Energy"" sector (heavily subsidized and driven by globalist policy agendas) and large agribusiness conglomerates (which control global food supply chains) also exert enormous influence on policy and resources, often in line with the broader agenda of centralization and control.The Globalist Institutional Nexus: Drivers of the Transition:Institutions such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), the United Nations (UN), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank are crucial for promoting global governance systems, harmonizing international policy, and socializing national elites into a globalist worldview.The WEF, under the leadership of Klaus Schwab, is a particularly outspoken ideological driver. Schwab's books, such as ""The Fourth Industrial Revolution"" (2016) and ""COVID-19: The Great Reset"" (2020, co-authored with Thierry Malleret), are not subtle treatises; they are explicit blueprints for a future where technology merges with humanity, global governance becomes paramount, and where, as he famously articulated the vision for 2030, ""You'll own nothing. And you'll be happy."" This is not a benign prediction; it is a formulated goal, a future designed for our passivity and their absolute control. The WEF's annual meetings in Davos are not mere networking events; they are strategy sessions where business leaders, politicians, academics, and media figures align on the implementation of this agenda. The WEF's ""Young Global Leaders"" program has also successfully placed its alumni in key positions in governments, businesses, and civil society worldwide, creating an influence network loyal to its vision.The United Nations, with its vast bureaucracy and numerous agencies, provides the framework and perceived legitimacy for global governance. Agenda 21 (from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992) and its successor, Agenda 2030 with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are often presented as benevolent plans for a better future. Critics such as the late Rosa Koire, in her book ""Behind the Green Mask: U.N. Agenda 21"" (2011), however, meticulously deconstructed Agenda 21 as a plan for centralized control over all human activities, resource allocation, and land use, under the guise of environmental protection and social justice. Patrick Wood, in works like ""Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation"" (2015), traces the roots of this agenda to the Technocracy movement of the 1930s, which advocated for a society run by engineers and technical experts. The official policy of the Kremlin, as articulated in various strategy documents and speeches by figures such as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, often emphasizes Russia's commitment to its own sovereign development path, and implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) criticizes the imposition of universalist, Western-led governance models promoted through UN frameworks when these conflict with national interests. In a joint statement in May 2024, President Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed their interest in ""creating a more just and democratic multipolar world order"" in which the UN plays a central role based on international law and respect for the diversity of civilizations.The World Health Organization (WHO), which was central during the COVID-19 crisis, is now pushing for a new international pandemic treaty and amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR). Critics, including numerous independent health professionals and legal scholars such as Dr. Meryl Nass and independent journalist James Roguski, warn that these proposed changes could grant the WHO Director-General unprecedented powers to declare pandemics and dictate binding health measures to sovereign nations, thereby effectively creating a supranational health dictatorship. James Roguski, for example, has highlighted specific proposed IHR amendments that he claims would ""remove protections for human rights"" and ""give the WHO the authority to mandate medical examinations, proof of prophylaxis, proof of vaccination and to implement contact tracing, quarantine and treatment.""The IMF and World Bank continue their role as enforcers of economic orthodoxy, trapping nations, particularly in the developing world, in debt and imposing structural adjustment programs that benefit global corporations and financial interests.The Ideological and Operational Arms: Shapers of Consensus and Enforcers of Policy:Influential think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, Chatham House (UK), the Brookings Institution, and numerous university departments receive significant funding from the corporate and philanthropic arms of this elite network. Their policy recommendations often align remarkably with the push towards global governance and technocratic solutions. The long history of the CFR in influencing US foreign policy, with its members regularly occupying high government positions, is well documented. Antony C. Sutton, in works like ""Trilaterals Over Washington"" (1979), provided critical analyses of the Trilateral Commission's role in shaping a global economic order favorable to international financial and corporate interests. Senator Barry Goldwater went so far in his book ""With No Apologies"" (1979) to describe the Trilateral Commission as ""a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four great centers of power: political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical."" Daniel Estulin's ""The True Story of the Bilderberg Group"" (2007) likewise sheds light on the secretive nature and influential agenda of the Bilderberg meetings.Prominent academics from elite universities provide the theories and legitimacy for global governance. Elements within intelligence agencies (such as the CIA, MI6) and ""deep state"" structures worldwide provide the operational capacity for covert operations, information warfare, and the management of dissenting views. The historical precedent of operations such as the CIA's Operation Mockingbird, aimed at influencing domestic and international media, as detailed in congressional investigations such as the Church Committee reports of the 1970s and by researchers like Deborah Davis, serves as a grim reminder of the ability of such entities to shape public perception.The common thread connecting these diverse actors is not necessarily a secret oath or a formal command structure, but rather a shared ideology and a convergence of interests. This ideology often includes the belief that national sovereignty is an outdated and inefficient concept in an interconnected world; that complex global challenges (such as climate change, pandemics, and economic stability, which are challenges their own policies often exacerbate) require centralized, technocratic management; and that ""progress"" entails a greater degree of global harmonization and control, often packaged in utopian terms of efficiency, equality, and sustainability. As my own research posits: ""The ultimate envisioned outcome is the introduction and normalization of a unified technocratic world order, characterized by a centralized digitized world currency, integrated digital identity systems, and a panoptic global governance framework, that may consolidate its fundamental elements by the target year 2030, in line with existing globalist agendas such as UN Agenda 2030.""II. The Strategy of Engineered Discontent: The Playbook of Crisis and ControlThe transition to this new world order cannot be achieved through democratic consent, as populations naturally cherish their freedom, autonomy, and cultural identity. Therefore, the primary strategy is Engineered Discontent: the deliberate creation or exacerbation of crises in all domains of human experience to break the will of the populace and make them receptive to radical, authoritarian ""solutions."" This is the application of the Hegelian dialectic on a planetary scale: Problem (create or amplify a crisis like war, pandemic, economic collapse, climate catastrophe, social division) -> Reaction (incite public fear, anger, confusion, and a desperate demand for solutions) -> Solution (offer the pre-planned technocratic, globalist agenda as the only way to restore order and security).A. The Information War: Manufacturing Reality and Managing DissentControl of information is paramount. As George Orwell chillingly depicted in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" (1949): ""Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."" The mainstream media (MSM), consolidated into a few corporate hands (e.g., Comcast, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, News Corp, Bertelsmann), functions as a global echo chamber, relentlessly amplifying official narratives and suppressing dissenting voices.Narrative Framing and External Threats: Geopolitical events are framed to serve specific agendas. The demonization of Russia and China as existential threats justifies enormous military budgets, aggressive foreign policy, and domestic surveillance. Complex historical contexts are erased. The conflict in Ukraine, for example, is almost universally presented in the MSM as an unprovoked act of Russian aggression. Little attention is paid to the preceding eight years of conflict in the Donbas after the 2014 Maidan coup, the estimated 14,000 deaths in that period, Ukraine's failure to implement the Minsk II accords (of which former German Chancellor Angela Merkel later admitted in a 2022 interview with Die Zeit that they were partly a ruse to ""give Ukraine time"" to build up its military), or the well-documented history of NATO expansion to Russia's borders, despite explicit and implicit guarantees to Soviet leaders in the early 1990s that this would not happen (a contentious point, but supported by declassified documents and testimonies from figures like Jack Matlock, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union). John Mearsheimer's realist analysis, which identifies NATO expansion as a major provocation leading to a predictable Russian response, is an example of the kind of nuanced perspective that is systematically excluded or demonized by the MSM.Censorship and Deplatforming: Big Tech platforms (Google/YouTube, Meta/Facebook, X/Twitter) have become the primary enforcers of narrative control. Sophisticated algorithms and armies of ""content moderators"" (often influenced by organizations such as the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which cooperates with Facebook to combat ""disinformation"") systematically suppress, shadow-ban, or deplatform individuals and alternative media outlets that challenge official narratives on COVID-19 (origins, vaccine safety, early treatments), election integrity, climate change science, or geopolitical conflicts. This creates an Orwellian ""memory hole"" where inconvenient truths simply disappear. The Twitter Files provided irrefutable evidence of this direct government interference with social media censorship.""Fact-Checking"" as Narrative Reinforcement: The rise of ""fact-checking"" organizations, often funded by entities with clear ideological or financial interests in the narratives they ""verify"" (e.g., the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network, with funding from Google, Facebook, and foundations like Gates and Soros's Open Society Foundations), serves in many cases as an instrument to delegitimize dissenting views and reinforce approved narratives. Their ""fact-checks"" often rely on appeals to authority (e.g., the WHO, CDC) instead of engaging substantively with counter-evidence, effectively functioning as a sophisticated form of censorship and narrative reinforcement.The Phenomenon of ""Controlled Opposition"":A more advanced aspect of media manipulation is the cultivation of ""controlled opposition."" Certain dissenting voices or narratives are allowed, or even subtly promoted, that, while appearing to challenge the status quo, ultimately serve the long-term agenda of the elites. As my analysis suggests, such figures can ""Channel Discontent"" into safe, ineffective outlets, preventing it from growing into real, effective resistance. They can help to ""Create Further Division"" by pitting different factions of ""opposition"" against each other. Their activities can also provide valuable ""Data Collection and Analysis"" opportunities for refining psychological operations. Sometimes they employ a ""Limited Hangout,"" an intelligence term referring to a tactic where a small, less harmful part of a truth is revealed to prevent a larger, more harmful truth from coming to light.The cumulative psychological impact of these strategies is devastating. It leads to a profound ""Erosion of Trust and Societal Fragmentation,"" and creates an ""Epistemic Crisis"" in which constructive public debate becomes impossible. It can induce ""Learned Helplessness"" and cynicism. Ultimately, it ""Prepares for Radical Change"" a population that has lost faith in existing systems.III. The Geopolitical Theater: Crisis as a Catalyst for Global RestructuringThe current intense Western-Russian antagonism, prominently centered on the conflict in Ukraine, is presented to the world public as an existential struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. While human suffering is undeniably real and tragic, the Engineered Discontent Hypothesis, as set out in my research, suggests that this conflict, at a deeper, strategic level, may function as a carefully orchestrated ""geopolitical theater."" The superficial narratives (Russia as an unprovoked aggressor or Russia responding to NATO expansion) conceal possible underlying agendas. My hypothesis posits that despite the public display of extreme hostility, ""a level of covert, structural cooperation or at least a tacit understanding could exist between key factions within major powers,"" not to serve traditional national interests, but to facilitate the shared, overarching agenda of a ""controlled demolition of the existing world order to pave the way for a technocratic global system.""The shared incentives for elites are numerous:Dismantling of National Sovereignty: Protracted, costly, and divisive conflicts exhaust national resources, discredit national leadership, and make populations more receptive to supranational solutions.Economic Restructuring: Wars provide a pretext for massive government spending, economic controls, and the reorganization of global supply chains and energy markets. This conflict, for example, has drastically accelerated efforts towards de-dollarization, with the BRICS+ countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and new members like Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia) actively seeking to trade in local currencies and developing alternatives to the SWIFT payment system. While this is often portrayed as a direct challenge to Western dominance, within the framework of my hypothesis, this could be a ""controlled demolition of the petrodollar system, paving the way for a global digital currency framework."" The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022, which severed a critical energy artery between Russia and Germany, fits this pattern of strategic economic disruption, regardless of the ultimate perpetrator (although investigative journalists like Seymour Hersh have presented convincing arguments pointing to US involvement).Population Control and Distraction: A major war focuses public attention, justifies restrictions on freedom in the name of national security, and distracts from other domestic or global issues that would otherwise be scrutinized.Testing of New Doctrines and Technologies: Conflicts serve as living laboratories for new military technologies, cyber warfare capabilities, and information warfare techniques.The mechanisms of this geopolitical theater include the intense polarization of populations, making rational discourse difficult; the systematic delegitimization of national leaders on all sides (Western leaders portrayed as warmongers or incompetent, Russian leadership as inherently evil); and the aforementioned economic warfare serving as a catalyst for broader systemic change. Even the role of international organizations such as the UN, NATO, and the EU is significant. While they play crucial roles in legitimizing the narratives and actions of the main players, their often questionable effectiveness in resolving the conflict can subtly highlight their limitations, thereby paving the way for more empowered, reformed global governance structures. The long warnings and preparations leading up to the conflict, such as the US intelligence agencies publicly predicting the 2022 invasion, could be interpreted not only as foresight but also as part of a managed escalation, turning the conflict into a ""useful crisis"" that simultaneously promotes multiple agendas: climate initiatives (via energy insecurity), digital identity and surveillance (for tracking sanctions), and censorship (to control the narrative).IV. The Deliberate Delegitimization of Political FigureheadsThe emergence and terms of office of highly polarizing political figureheads, such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden in the United States, and similar figures in other nations, are not seen by this hypothesis as mere accidents in political history. Instead, as my analysis posits, they are considered ""potentially intentional or at least strategically exploited catalysts for delegitimizing presidential/prime ministerial authority, eroding public trust in government institutions, and exacerbating societal divisions to a point of near irreconcilability.""The presidency of Donald Trump was characterized by an ""Erosion of Decorum and Norms."" His unconventional style and challenges to established institutions fundamentally changed public perception. While he addressed genuine grievances, the ""Weaponization of 'Populism'"" served primarily to deepen societal divides.The presidency of Joe Biden is characterized by ""Perceptions of Weakness and Incompetence,"" historically low approval ratings, and a continuation of divisive policies.Scandals, such as the controversies surrounding the business dealings of Hunter Biden, particularly his involvement with Burisma in Ukraine and entities in China, seem suspiciously opportune. As my research notes, these sagas, with accusations of influence peddling and corruption, ""play directly into pre-existing public cynicism about political corruption"" and reinforce ""'Deep State' Narratives,"" thereby eroding faith not only in specific politicians but in the democratic process itself. The ultimate goal, as hypothesized, is the ""Demolition of Trust in National Governance,"" destroying faith in elections, weakening national cohesion, and creating a demand for ""neutral"" technocratic oversight. The Dutch referendum of 2016 on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, where a 61% ""No"" vote (on a 32% turnout) was ultimately ignored by the government, serves as a powerful example of how national democratic processes can be overridden, further fueling this disillusionment.V. COVID-19: The Global Catalyst for Systemic RestructuringThe global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in early 2020, marks a turning point. As my analysis posits, it served as an ""unprecedented catalyst for accelerating distrust towards governments, pharmaceutical industries, traditional media, and global institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO)."" While the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its health effects were empirically real, the management of the pandemic and the subsequent socio-economic turmoil are hypothesized to have been strategically leveraged.Erosion of Trust through Pandemic Management:This was achieved through ""Inconsistent and Contradictory Public Health Messages"" about the origin of the virus, masks, lockdowns, and vaccines. The initial dismissal and suppression of the ""Virus Origin"" lab-leak hypothesis (with figures like Dr. Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, which funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, playing a key role in orchestrating statements such as the February 2020 Lancet letter condemning such theories), only for it to later gain more mainstream credibility, created deep distrust. The ""Lockdowns and Economic Devastation"" disproportionately benefited large corporations while destroying small businesses.Vaccine Development, Mandates, and Safety Concerns: The ""Rapid Development and 'Warp Speed'"" approval of mRNA vaccines raised legitimate questions for many about long-term safety. Initial ""Efficacy Claims"" about preventing infection and transmission were later significantly modified. ""Mandates and Coercion"" were deeply divisive. Most critically, the ""Censorship of Adverse Event Reports and Dissenting Medical Opinions"" was pervasive. Platforms and media systematically suppressed or discredited doctors and scientists (e.g., Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Pierre Kory) who expressed concerns about vaccine safety or advocated for alternative treatment protocols. This censorship created an environment in which many felt their legitimate concerns were actively silenced.The Pharmaceutical Industry and Conflicts of Interest:The immense ""Profit Motives"" of pharmaceutical companies and the ""Liability Shields"" granted by governments fueled public suspicion. The historical precedent of misconduct by some pharmaceutical giants further fueled skepticism.Global Institutions and Centralized Control: The WHO's handling of the pandemic drew widespread criticism, while proposals emerged to grant it greater powers through a ""pandemic treaty."" As noted in my analysis, this is seen as ""a clear step towards centralized global governance."" The WEF, with its ""Great Reset"" initiative (Klaus Schwab stating, ""The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity...""), openly advocated for using the crisis to restructure the global economy and society, promoting concepts such as digital identity and stakeholder capitalism.COVID-19, as my research suggests, served as a massive ""'Psyop' and Social Engineering Experiment,"" testing compliance, normalizing surveillance (digital health passes), fueling division, and accelerating the digital transformation, thereby ""Paving the Way for Unprecedented Societal Restructuring.""VI. Economic Destabilization: The Forced Shift to TechnocracyThe increasing economic difficulties, including housing market crises, persistent inflation, engineered energy shortages, and the unaffordability of basic necessities, are interpreted by this hypothesis not as mere policy mistakes, but as components of a deliberate strategy. As detailed in my analysis, the ""Multiple Attack on Economic Stability"" includes:Inflationary Pressure: Decades of expansionary monetary policy (quantitative easing, near-zero interest rates) by central banks, massively accelerated during COVID-19.Disruptions in the Supply Chain: As a result of lockdowns, geopolitical conflicts, and possibly deliberate policy choices related to ""green"" transitions.Energy Policy: The aggressive push for renewable energy, often at the expense of reliable and affordable fossil fuel infrastructure, has contributed to the volatility of energy prices.Housing Market Crises: Fueled by artificially inflated asset bubbles and corporate ownership of homes.This leads to an ""Erosion of the Middle Class and Growing Inequality.""A key element is the ""Strategic Dismantling of the Petrodollar-Based Economy."" The rise of BRICS+ countries and their efforts towards de-dollarization are seen as a ""controlled demolition phase."" The ""Green Transition"" itself is seen as an ""Economic Lever"" that necessitates a massive reorganization of the world economy, creating new dependencies and potential shocks. Furthermore, ""Automation, AI, and the Displacement of Traditional Employment"" exacerbate job insecurity and social anxiety, with figures like Yuval Noah Harari openly discussing the possible emergence of a ""'useless class.'""The intended outcome, as my analysis posits, is to drive populations to accept technocratic solutions:Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Presented as efficient and stable, but giving governments unprecedented control. Agust√≠n Carstens, general manager of the BIS, famously stated about CBDCs: ""...the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use... and also we will have the technology to enforce that."" This implies programmability (expiring funds, restricted purchases) and total surveillance.Universal Basic Income (UBI): Marketed as a compassionate solution to job loss, but if linked to digital ID and CBDC, it becomes a powerful instrument for social control.Digital Identity Systems: Essential for managing CBDCs and UBI, centralizing vast amounts of personal data.""Smart Cities"" and Resource Management: Implying constant data collection and centralized control.Global Carbon Taxes and Social Credit Systems: Linked to digital IDs and CBDCs to monitor and control individual behavior.VII. The Emergence of a Unified World Currency and Digital GovernanceThe culmination of this engineered discontent, as my research argues, is the ""legitimization and acceleration of the adoption of a unified global digital currency, intrinsically linked to a comprehensive digital identity system and an overarching technocratic global governance framework."" This is the phoenix designed to rise from the ashes of engineered chaos.Crisis of Confidence in Existing Financial Structures: Devaluation of fiat currency through inflation, instability of the banking system, and unsustainable national debts undermine confidence in the current system.CBDCs as the ""Solution"": Their publicly touted benefits (efficiency, inclusion) mask underlying control mechanisms: programmability, surveillance, social engineering, and the eventual elimination of cash. The ""race to launch"" CBDCs by numerous countries (China's digital yuan, ECB's digital euro project) creates a sense of inevitability.The Role of BRICS and ""De-Dollarization"": Interpreted not as a genuine challenge, but as ""Facilitating the Transition"" by accelerating the collapse of the dollar-centric system, thereby paving the way for a global digital currency. The emergence of multiple major CBDCs could be a phase of ""Competing Prototypes"" before eventual integration.Digital Identity: The Linchpin: Involving the ""Integration of All Data"" (financial, health, travel, social) and serving as an ""Access Control"" mechanism for societal participation. Global standardization efforts (UN, WEF) are underway.This leads to Technocratic Governance, promising stability and equality after periods of chaos, but achieved through ""'Expert' Rule"" by algorithms and unaccountable global bodies. The psychological shift from discontent to acceptance is managed through the ""Problem-Reaction-Solution"" dynamic.VIII. Psychological Conditioning: Manufacturing Consent for the New World OrderThe transition to this technocratic world order requires a profound psychological shift, as my analysis detailed.The Hegelian Dialectic in Practice (Problem-Reaction-Solution):Crises are manipulated or amplified to generate fear and a demand for solutions, which are then offered by the elites.The Proliferation of ""Controlled Conspiracy Theories"": This serves to ""Muddy the Waters,"" discredit genuine investigation, act as ""Predictive Programming"" to normalize concepts, create ""Cynicism and Apathy,"" or facilitate ""Limited Hangouts.""",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:52:33.742548,"['Negative', 'Cherry-picked quotes and unsubstantiated claims characterize several arguments.', 'Global elite are engineering crises to establish a technocratic world order.']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"
Could Indian Real Estate Prices Crash in 30 Years as Black Money Declines?,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/1k3uuef/could_indian_real_estate_prices_crash_in_30_years/,r/IndiaInvestments,2025-04-20T19:47:02.039000+0000,73,78,"This is more of a longterm macroeconomic theory, and I‚Äôd love to hear what others here think.A big reason why real estate prices in India are so high today is because of black money. For decades, property has been one of the safest ways to park unaccounted wealth. A lot of deals even today involve large amounts of cash, which pushes property prices way above what most people can actually afford through regular income.But things are changing fast. Digital payments are becoming the norm everywhere, even in small towns. The younger generation is growing up using UPI, cards, and digital wallets. They don‚Äôt rely on or even carry much cash. At the same time, the government is pushing hard toward a cashless economy and cracking down on black money with more regulation and tech-driven surveillance.There‚Äôs also the possibility that we‚Äôll see a complete shift to digital currency in the future like the RBI‚Äôs CBDC which could make it almost impossible to use large amounts of unaccounted cash. On top of that, the generation that built wealth through black money and invested heavily in real estate is aging. As that generation fades out, their financial practices might disappear with them.So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering,if black money disappears from the system and can no longer be easily used in real estate, will property prices stop growing or even drop? Will real estate lose its shine as a long-term investment the way our parents and grandparents saw it?Is this a realistic concern, or am I overthinking it?

Could Indian Real Estate Prices Crash in 30 Years as Black Money Declines?,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k3utcg/could_indian_real_estate_prices_crash_in_30_years/,r/IndianStockMarket,2025-04-20T19:45:38.767000+0000,49,36,"This is more of a longterm macroeconomic theory, and I‚Äôd love to hear what others here think.A big reason why real estate prices in India are so high today is because of black money. For decades, property has been one of the safest ways to park unaccounted wealth. A lot of deals even today involve large amounts of cash, which pushes property prices way above what most people can actually afford through regular income.But things are changing fast. Digital payments are becoming the norm everywhere, even in small towns. The younger generation is growing up using UPI, cards, and digital wallets. They don‚Äôt rely on or even carry much cash. At the same time, the government is pushing hard toward a cashless economy and cracking down on black money with more regulation and tech-driven surveillance.There‚Äôs also the possibility that we‚Äôll see a complete shift to digital currency in the future like the RBI‚Äôs CBDC which could make it almost impossible to use large amounts of unaccounted cash. On top of that, the generation that built wealth through black money and invested heavily in real estate is aging. As that generation fades out, their financial practices might disappear with them.So here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering,if black money disappears from the system and can no longer be easily used in real estate, will property prices stop growing or even drop? Will real estate lose its shine as a long-term investment the way our parents and grandparents saw it?Is this a realistic concern, or am I overthinking it? Curious to hear what others in this sub believe, especially those planning their portfolios for the next 20‚Äì30 years.","{'comment_id': 't1_mo5324j', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1k3utcg/comment/mo5324j/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'General Guidelines - Buy/Sell and one-liner posts will be removed.

While XRP has recovered from its low of $1.96 reached on March 11, the coin remains 30.9% below its all-time high of $3.40. Why XRP‚Äôs Performance Remains Lackluster In a recent X post, Former London fund manager DigitalG shared his thoughts on XRP‚Äôs current downward trend. The pundit claimed that XRP‚Äôs dull price performance emanates from Ripple‚Äôs dual-ledger system. This is in reference to the company‚Äôs concurrent use of the public XRP Ledger (XRPL) and a private version utilized by banks. The private Ledger is built on the same technology as the public one and can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS).Per DigitalG, financial institutions might be buying huge volumes of XRP via the private ledger, which supports Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and enterprise use cases. Compared to the public XRPL, this private ledger operates with restricted access by approved entities, controlled visibility, and centralized control by institutions. DigitalG argues that this disparity could be disguising the true value of XRP, as demand from institutions is not reflected in public exchange prices. However, he believes ‚Äúsome regulators could suggest it is fraudulent to conceal the true price of an asset.‚Äù One commentator on X opposed this view, suggesting that XRP‚Äôs price is a laggard because a boatload of retail investors hold it. In his opinion, XRP ‚Äúwas never really designed‚Äù for small retail investors to hold. The X user implied that Ripple would first tire out retail investors before merging the two ledgers. In response, DigitalG asked the commentator to imagine offloading XRP at $2.30 while its true value was actually $15,840 ‚Äî but that value was hidden from the general public. Ripple‚Äôs XRPL And Private Ledger To Converge And Send XRP Soaring DigitalG further suggested that the private ledger/CBDC ledger and the XRP Ledger will converge on July 14. This in his opinion, could spark a dramatic change in XRP‚Äôs market fortunes. The pundit cited a vague reference that claims the Fedwire Funds Services is set to implement ISO 20022 on July 14. How this relates to Ripple and the XRP Ledger is unclear.","{'comment_id': 't1_migh5zh', 'upvote': 0, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'Comment deleted by user', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_migo5gz', 'upvote': 21, 'depth': 1, 'permalink': '/r/XRP/comments/1je6pdo/comment/migo5gz/', 'parent_id': 't1_migh5zh', 'comment_body': 'Totally.

Trump signed an executive order to ban Central Bank Digital Currencies.

While the press focuses on war, abortions, gender and immigration. The single most policy of the century seemed to get some of the least attention.This post will probably even get lower engagement than other posts because most people don't know anything about this and would rather argue over whether politicians are fascists or not. Well if you're so concerned about fascism...What is a CBDC?Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital government controlled money. Unlike Bitcoin or cash, which you can use freely, a CBDC would be fully tracked monetary netowrk controlled by the government. Every transaction would be monitored, and access to your money could be restricted at any time.CBDCs are fascistic and a direct threat to democracy and personal freedom.If a government controls your money at the push of a button, they control you. They could freeze accounts of political opponents, limit spending based on ‚Äúsocial credit scores,‚Äù or even expire your money if you don‚Äôt follow their rules. This is straight up authoritarianism. It gives the government total financial surveillance and the ability to silence dissent. There is no democracy when your ability to buy food or pay rent depends on whether you‚Äôre obedient.And here‚Äôs the thing...if a CBDC was implemented, no other policy would matter anymore. The debate over taxes, gun rights, free speech, healthcare, or immigration? None of it would matter if the government could just shut off your money if you disagreed with them. Think about it: What good is the right to bear arms if the government simply prevents you from buying a gun or ammunition? What good is free speech if saying the wrong thing gets your bank account frozen?. What use is woman's rights if they can restrict your movements for having an abortion.If CBDCs existed, voting wouldn‚Äôt even matter because elections wouldn‚Äôt decide policy anymore...whoever controlled the money supply would have absolute power over the entire country. Did you vote lr show support for the wrong candidate?. Didn't get the vaccine we wanted you to take?. How about we restrict your access to entertainments? How about we turn off your abilty to buy certain food?We don‚Äôt have to guess what this would look like. China has already implemented a social credit system tied to its digital yuan CBDC. In China, citizens can be punished for things like criticizing the government, playing too many video games, or even not visiting their elderly parents enough. A low social credit score can ban you from booking flights, riding trains, getting loans, or even staying at certain hotels. With a CBDC, the government doesn‚Äôt need police or courts to control people...it just turns off their ability to participate in society. If you protest, your digital money could simply stop working for gas stations or public transport, trapping you in place. This is totalitarian control at a level never seen before in history.But it gets even worse. CBDCs can be programmed to expire, meaning your money must be spent by a certain date or it disappears. This eliminates saving and forces people into permanent dependence on the government. They can also decide to combat inflation by imposing negative interest rates, draining your account over time if you don‚Äôt spend fast enough. This is a form of economic slavery. It‚Äôs not just financial control... it‚Äôs a system designed to make sure you can never build independence or wealth outside of government-approved channels.This is economic fascism in its purest form. Fascism isn‚Äôt just military dictatorship....it‚Äôs the merger of state and corporate power to control society. A CBDC would give the government and central banks total economic control, but it would also let them dictate what businesses can and can‚Äôt do. Small businesses that don‚Äôt comply with government mandates could be cut off from transactions. Mega corporations that obey the regime would be rewarded with financial privileges. This is how fascist economies function through state directed control over private industry, forcing businesses and individuals into compliance through economic pressure instead of direct law.And make no mistake....this was the Democrats‚Äô plan. Biden‚Äôs administration was actively pushing for a CBDC. In March 2022, he signed Executive Order 14067, which directed federal agencies to begin researching and developing a U.S. CBDC. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen openly advocated for it, and the Federal Reserve had already started working on prototypes. The Democrat establishment, backed by the corporate elite, wanted a system where every dollar was programmable, trackable, and controllable.People love to call Trump a dictator, but a dictator would love a CBDC. It would give them total control over the economy and every citizen. If Trump was really a dictator, he wouldn‚Äôt be banning them...he‚Äôd be pushing for them. The fact that he banned CBDCs proves the opposite: He actually took away a tool that could be used for totalitarian control.Nobody is talking about this, but they should be. This is bigger than any tax cut or trade deal. This is about whether we live in a free society or a digital prison.","{'comment_id': 't1_meb8t1g', 'upvote': 50, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1iw5j6s/comment/meb8t1g/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""I hadn't heard about this.

The council will bring together government officials, regulators, and experts to ensure the sustainable development of the crypto industry, eliminate high transaction fees, and minimize financial risks. üìä‚öñÔ∏èBack in 2022, the Central Bank of Pakistan attempted to ban cryptocurrencies, but authorities are now revising this approach. In November 2024, the regulator introduced initiatives for launching a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and legalizing crypto transactions. These measures align with global trends, as the U.S., Europe, and the UAE actively implement crypto regulations to balance innovation and security. üåéüîóThe Trump administration is also strengthening its support for the crypto industry: the SEC is being reformed, a committee on digital assets has been created, and the former president himself has launched a memecoin. The meeting with Pakistani authorities included blockchain experts and entrepreneurs, which could accelerate the legalization of cryptocurrencies in the country.

Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN) introduces Tokenized Deposit and Stablecoin Management System,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1j3s93g/universal_digital_payments_network_udpn/,r/Hedera,2025-03-05T02:08:15.287000+0000,61,7,"The Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN) has integrated Hedera Hashgraph's technology to enhance its digital payment services, particularly in the areas of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In September 2024, GFT and Red Date Technology collaborated to incorporate stablecoins issued via Hedera's Stablecoin Studio and CBDCs from EMTECH's CBDC Sandbox into the UDPN framework. This integration facilitates the development of programmable payment applications utilizing these digital currencies on the Hedera network.During this integration, GFT developed and integrated two custom transaction nodes into the UDPN: one supporting stablecoins launched with Hedera's Stablecoin Studio and another supporting CBDCs from the EMTECH CBDC Sandbox. These nodes connect the UDPN to digital currency systems through a unified transaction gateway, enabling transfers, transactions, and query results. Following successful transaction processing on Hedera, these nodes were deployed in a dedicated test environment. The HBAR Foundation and Hedera Hashgraph were then invited to test UDPN's core services, including decentralized identity creation, mapping these identities to Hedera accounts, and initiating transfers and cross-chain swaps.This integration leverages Hedera's high-performance network to address scalability challenges associated with Layer 1 blockchains, aiming to provide more efficient transaction processing for stablecoins and CBDCs. The collaboration between UDPN and Hedera represents a significant step toward connecting Hedera with the broader digital currency ecosystem, facilitating real-world use cases for digital currencies.https://www.hbarfoundation.org/blog-post/udpn-integrates-stablecoins-and-cbdcs-issued-on-the-hedera-network","{'comment_id': 't1_mg36ns8', 'upvote': 13, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/Hedera/comments/1j3s93g/comment/mg36ns8/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""Huge.

Given that the Trump administration has so far taken a pro-crypto posture, this comes at a very interesting time. During the presidential campaign, President Trump made it clear that he opposed CBDCs, which further solidified his administration's support for crypto.Since CBDCs are totally anti-crypto, I believe that this delay in their release is positive for the market. Unlike ETH, CBDCs are issued and controlled by the government, which is completely opposed to the spirit of anonymity and independence that crypto promotes. Because CBDCs would let central banks to monitor and manage each transaction, they bring serious privacy issues and jeopardize the financial anonymity that crypto users value most. Again, the anonymity that comes from Ethereum, where transactions are pseudonymous and less traceable, is a strong opposition to the surveillance power of CBDCs.Knowing that the Trump administration is pro-crypto and anti-CBDC, the timing of these delays seems to indicate a favorable environment for the development and acceptance of decentralized digital assets, confirming an important moment where regulatory uncertainty could cause an acceleration in adoption.Source:https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1889570131182751942","{'comment_id': 't1_mccxyk7', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/ethtrader/comments/1inqdjg/comment/mccxyk7/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""MasterpieceLoud4931, this comment  logs the Pay2Post fee, an anti-spam mechanism where a DONUT 'tax' is deducted from your distribution share for each post submitted.

You guys need to think LONG term with this project,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ondo/comments/1ix9ep4/you_guys_need_to_think_long_term_with_this_project/,r/Ondo,2025-02-24T18:41:42.680000+0000,13,5,"In the crypto space, there are essentially two types of coins:1. VaporwareThis category constitutes roughly 99% of the crypto market. These coins, whether meme-based or seemingly ‚Äúserious‚Äù projects, often show a massive pump followed by a steep decline, rarely reaching their previous all-time highs again.Projects like DOGE, PEPE, and even some that appear solid like NEO, DASH, or BCH can generate huge gains short term. You enter early and exit quickly. Otherwise, your gains may gradually vanish over time.2. Real ProjectsThese are built to last and aim to solve genuine real-world problems. In a future where every nation might have its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), possibly even backed by a Bitcoin reserve, these projects are likely to remain relevant. Identifying them isn‚Äôt always straightforward; the tech landscape is unpredictable, and new competitors can disrupt established players with more efficient and cost-effective solutions.A good strategy is to consider the institutional backing behind a project.For example, Chainlink is collaborating with SWIFT‚Äîa partnership that could prove crucial if CBDCs become mainstream‚Äîindicating Chainlink‚Äôs long-term potential. Ripple, too, has secured partnerships with major industry players.Although ONDO is relatively new compared to Ethereum, Chainlink, or XRP, it falls into the same category regarding potential longevity, particularly because it has been backed by influential institutions like BlackRock from day one.In summary, this is a long road‚Äîmuch like the journey observed after the dotcom bubble. If you consistently dollar-cost average into projects with strong fundamentals, such as LINK, XRP, ONDO, and others, you could be in a position similar to early investors in companies like Amazon, Oracle, and Microsoft during the early 2000s.ConclusionUltimately, your strategy boils down to a choice: either adopt a disciplined, long-term approach by investing in projects with strong fundamentals and institutional backing, or chase after volatile meme coins in pursuit of quick gains.The long-term approach‚Äîakin to early investments in companies like Amazon and Microsoft‚Äîcan offer a steadier path to building lasting wealth, while the allure of meme coins often comes with high risk and uncertainty.

Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Slams Wyoming‚Äôs Stablecoin As CBDC,https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1iiix0j/cardano_founder_charles_hoskinson_slams_wyomings/,r/cardano,2025-02-05T19:46:52.685000+0000,49,16,"What the hell is going on in Wyoming?Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Slams Wyoming‚Äôs Stablecoin As CBDCDuring a livestream that aired on February 4th 2025, Charles Hoskinson delivered a stark rebuke of Wyoming‚Äôs plan to develop a state-backed stablecoin. Charles alleges that‚Äúfreeze and seize‚Äùrequirements - enabled by cryptographic tools to prevent or reverse transactions - were never openly disclosed in a proper product requirements document (PRD), effectively excluding Cardano and other major blockchain platforms from contention.Charles¬†remarks¬†focus on the absence of transparency in Wyomings procurement process. According to Charles, the state failed to publish or share a detailed PRD that outlines key must have features, such as the ability to freeze or seize tokens under certain legal or regulatory conditions. He says that this omission not only prevents fair competition but also poses risks to user privacy and broader blockchain adoption.‚ÄúWe were told it would be an open process and we would know ahead of time what the product requirements would be,‚ÄùCharles says during the video.‚ÄúInstead, they hid the PRD.. and decided to qualify people themselves.‚ÄùCharles contends that Wyoming‚Äôs selection criteria were only disclosed after the fact, at which point the state allegedly gave less than five days for companies to prove they could meet the freeze & seize requirement. The Cardano ecosystem, he argues, could have implemented such a feature in approximately two weeks if it had been explicitly included in the PRD from the outset.To highlight Cardano‚Äôs capabilities, Charles contrasts fully programmable blockchains like Cardano and Ethereum with so-called‚Äúfixed-function‚Äùledgers, including XRP. Programmable chains allow developers to build new features directly into smart contracts, meaning a freeze & seize capability can be added if required.‚ÄúOn Cardano or Ethereum, if there‚Äôs something the protocol doesn‚Äôt support natively, you write a smart contract,‚ÄùCharles explains.‚ÄúSo, if we had known freeze-and-seize was a Hardline product requirement, we could have simply written a contract to satisfy it.‚ÄùCharles points to what he calls a mischaracterization by officials overseeing Wyoming‚Äôs stable coin project, who had stated that Cardano did not meet this criterion without clarifying the short timeline or undisclosed requirements.Throughout the video, Charles implies that the process may have been orchestrated to favor a particular blockchain solution, suggesting that one of the decision-makers previously worked with the platform being singled out for the project. He underscores that no open bidding or public discussion took place on the critical features of the stablecoin.Charles also critiques the idea that Wyoming‚Äôs stablecoin would be functionally similar to a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) because of its freeze-and-seize feature and transparent ledger, warning that this undermines financial privacy. In his view, this architecture gives authorities - or even third parties - the power to monitor all transactions and freeze funds at will.‚ÄúIf you hold Wyoming stablecoin, know that everything you buy is monitored and tracked,‚Äù Charles says.‚ÄúAt any given time, civil asset forfeiture‚Ä¶ they can just seize it.‚ÄùCharles questions the logic of investing state resources to build a product that, in his estimation, competes head-on with more established players - such as Tether or Circle - which have far larger budgets and market share.In his remarks, Charles underscores the economic challenges Wyoming‚Äôs stablecoin could face, citing a modest $5.8 million budget and a rapidly shifting regulatory environment. He argues that established stablecoin issuers generate billions in revenue and can pivot quickly to acquire or adapt to new regulations, leaving little room for a nascent state-backed project to gain market traction.‚ÄúTether made $13 billion last year. Circle made basically the same,‚ÄùCharles notes, pointing out the intense competition.‚ÄúYou have a $5.8 million budget‚Ä¶ and at the end of the day, you‚Äôre sitting on a CBDC in Wyoming.‚ÄùCharles further questions why the state would not simply‚Äúwhite label‚Äùan existing stablecoin infrastructure rather than build from scratch, noting that negotiating a share of Treasury bill revenue or interest payments could theoretically benefit Wyoming without incurring large development costs.Charles, who lives in Wheatland, Wyoming, frames his criticism as a defense of local residents. He argues that public funds are being jeopardized in a venture that may fail to deliver a meaningful benefit to the state‚Äôs taxpayers. In his view, had the PRD been openly available - particularly the freeze & seize requirement - Cardano, among other platforms, would have submitted a bid more aligned with the state‚Äôs purported goals.‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt deserve that,‚ÄùCharles says of Wyoming‚Äôs workforce.‚ÄúThis is not how procurement works‚Ä¶ not how anybody should operate.‚ÄùHe calls on officials, including state legislators, to scrutinize the project more rigorously, emphasizing the need for robust debate about whether the stablecoin, as presently structured, aligns with Wyoming‚Äôs pro-innovation image or inadvertently creates a centralized digital currency under federal oversight.What is happening in Wyoming.

While some are interpreting this as bearish, it‚Äôs actually more bullish for XRP and Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem. Here‚Äôs why:CBDC Ban Protects Private Blockchain Solutions:The ban on U.S. CBDCs removes competition from a government-controlled digital currency. Ripple‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution and XRP can step in as a neutral, bridge currency for cross-border payments‚Äîa space Ripple already dominates globally. This clears the path for private-sector innovations like XRP.2. Clear Regulatory Framework Incoming:The working group created by the order aims to provide regulatory clarity for crypto. Uncertainty has been one of the biggest roadblocks for institutional adoption in the U.S. Regulatory clarity gives Ripple and XRP more room to operate lawfully and attract institutions.3. Stablecoin Development Benefits XRP:The order promotes the development of stablecoins that are dollar-backed. Ripple has been working on its own stablecoin projects, and XRP can still be the bridge asset in a world where multiple stablecoins coexist. This aligns with Ripple‚Äôs focus on interoperability.4. XRP‚Äôs Global Advantage:Ripple has already partnered with over 100 financial institutions globally and continues expanding in regions that are friendly to digital assets. The U.S. ban on CBDCs doesn‚Äôt affect Ripple‚Äôs partnerships with other countries‚Äô central banks or their CBDC initiatives.5. National Digital Asset Stockpile:The inclusion of a ‚Äúnational digital asset stockpile‚Äù is intriguing. XRP, with its massive liquidity and real-world use case, could easily be considered for this stockpile. XRP‚Äôs scalability and transaction speed make it ideal for such purposes.6. XRP‚Äôs Market Reaction:If this order were truly bearish, we would have seen a significant sell-off. Instead, XRP has shown resilience. Smart money understands that this order clears hurdles for Ripple and supports a crypto-friendly infrastructure in the U.S.Bottom line: This executive order is about creating a foundation for digital asset growth while rejecting the concept of a government-controlled currency.

Then using ""covid"" to shut down supply lines. So they increased demand while simultaneously restricting supply to create inflation --- which was the means by which interest rates around the world were increased. Which was precisely the Going Direct plan!!!)But just 2-3 days after that crisis Trump signed Executive Order 13887... And again, someone would have to have wool over their eyes to look at that and not see it was part of the setup for Covid.As far as Trump not being a career politician... It\'s important to remember that the office of president isn\'t one of singular power like most people believe.Rather -- it\'s more like a figurehead position. A face of power. So that an agenda can be pushed forth and that face is there to take the blame, so when the people realize they were duped --- the face can go and people will think out with the bad and in with the good.But behind the scenes, the same power structure exists.So the elections are more like a contest to see ""which candidate will the people trust the most?"" And then they swap parties when they need a chapter change. To move in what is perceptually a different direction, but is usually just a rebranding of the same direction!Or sometimes it\'s a Bust/Boom cycle -- perceived as two parts but really part of the same cycle, and all intentional.What\'s interesting about the rebranding, though, is they really didn\'t hide it... Throughout 2023-24 the WEF people were talking about the need to ""rebuild trust"" with the people.So this was all planned, and they\'re doing things which don\'t cost anything but make us trust Trump. Releasing those documents? It won\'t make a difference. Anyone involved is dead now, and the juiciest stuff was probably never recorded to begin with.Removing men from women\'s sports? Great, but... Again, what does it really get us? I just paid $12.50 for 18 generic eggs from Wal-Mart. They cost even more at a normal grocery store.The CBDC ban feels great... But what if that was just an imaginary threat all along? So they can then cancel it to build our trust? Or what if they\'re planning on rolling it out in 2028 or 2032 so there\'s no harm in banning now?And withdrawing from WHO? Great. But maybe their next vaccine plan is 2028 or 2032? Again, they can just go back to it.The Paris Agreement is interesting, and I love moving away from electric car incentives.Lots of good things, but they might just be low hanging fruit that doesn\'t cost them anything...Imagine a man that beats his wife and leaves the house drunk.

You can only use them if you have an existing mobile line with them. This just limits your customer base to be successful. They are just introducing it to retain customers so they have one more thing to worry about when switching Telco.Why are the Telco wasting money developing the same functionality rather than try to provide other useful services. Aren't the Telco all under DA. While this is probably anti competitive to say but DA should have just stopped them from the start in developing these e-wallets separately wasting resources. Just let a company like Pocket provide these services.Pocket has the advantage of not being bound to Telco and you don't even have to top up the wallet to use. The only advantage that Telco has is their existing customer base.Not to mention you have the bank version also BIBD QuickPay, Baiduri Qpay.

I can confidently say it won't.Free fall of a currency usually happens only in one case - hyperinflation. Hyperinflation could be caused either due to excessive money printing or if the economy is totally fucked (either due to massive natural disasters as in the case of Pakistan or due to shitty government policies as in the case of Sri Lanka or maybe a war like in the case of Russia). To put it simply, currency trading is just a proxy for exchanging goods/services between countries. If, for some reason, your own production (exports to be more precise) massively goes down, your currency goes down with it.In a country as massive and economically diverse as India, it is almost impossible. The government would have to do something really fucked up for that to happen.On the other hand, I totally agree that the rupee could go on sliding down against the dollar little by little and it is actually more likely than the rupee strengthening over time. The reason for this is that our trade deficit has been growing over time. The solution to that would be to keep the trade deficit in check - do not let it grow.The reason I'm so strongly against central bank intervention is that it is just a short term solution meant for optics - to protect the image of the government.

I\'m not doubting that. Hes not doubting that.The issue is after I got there and locked it all down from the Lloyds end, getting hold of Revolut and trying to stop money leaving the middleman account (which was in my neighbours name with all his details) was a nightmare.There is no phone line to call.

We then asked to have the account frozen and while waiting for the response, the chat timed out and we had to start again.We never got the account frozen.

I report my taxes as I should and will continue to.There are amazing ways to make money in Crypto, amazing opportunities for everyone, nations to be involved. At the end of the day, there are bad actors in the space, bad actors/laundering with cash as well. There truly is no way around it. Atleast blockchain is traceable. Maybe I\'m biased here, but I was into Crypto long before I was an adult, as for stocks I could not. It has given me insane opportunity.I think people need to get away from the ""I\'m anonymous, government can\'t control my money like a bank can!"" kind of ideology if they want to see a foreseeable future in crypto for themselves. The decentralized part literally is you, being in charge of YOUR own funds / movements. Doesn\'t mean you need to be a secretive ass spy or something lol.

Chinese trade surplus increase from 2020 to 2025. From $355 billion (2.4% of GDP) to $1.1 trillion (6% of GDP). It‚Äôs clearly export obsessed and routing exports to west and India via ASEAN and Mexico. (I considered China and Hong Kong-Macau together).BRICS multi-currency basket : India and China can‚Äôt agree with Trade in mutual currencies because of Trust issue. We are still trading in $. China has more faith in $ than Rupee. It could have easily traded with us in Rupees and parked it‚Äôs trade surplus in India in INR bonds but it‚Äôs not happening.De-dollarization by 2030 due to bad US Macro conditions: US macro conditions were bad since Vietnam war hence Nixon shock (stoppage of convertibility of $ to Gold) happened. Global reserve $ is linked to Petrol since Gulf countries are forced to sell petrol in $. If Gulf sell oil in other currencies, they will face Islamist coup and regime change. US controls $ through military pressure on Gulf not through economic StrengthEverything is scripted - 93% are aligned with De-dollariazation: No evidence is provided here for this argument. Europe was buying russian oil/gas in Euros and Ukraine war stopped it, now Europe is buying it's energy in $ instead of Euros. Seems like Dollarization of allies event to me not De-dollarization like Ankit saysExcessive praise of Modi‚Äôs policies and ignoring failures: India‚Äôs trade deficit with China doubled from 2014 to 2024. Majority of that is Cheap consumer goods. DMart and Amazon are full of cheap Chinese products killing our manufacturing. In Modi‚Äôs time Chinese Cellphone brands captured Indian market and our domestic brands like Micromax died completely. We did nothing to stop this from happening. I would have preferred Adani/Ambani‚Äôs Cellphone brands than Chinese onesPromotion of Family owned business: As long as Cheap Chinese imports are allowed, our small businesses can‚Äôt compete with their products. Even our innovative products get copied by Chinese and dumped in India (Indian government doesn‚Äôt support by putting massive tariffs like Trump is doing). Our tariffs on consumer goods are very less.Promotion of Retail business in eCommerce time: Amazon/Flipkart has advantages like cheap warehouses outside cities instead of expensive retail shops inside the city, Bulk deal advantage, Use of Robotics and AI for packing products. Here people will start talking about $ funding completely ignoring other factors. Now even if $ funding has stopped, they can still outcompete small retail businesses based on above advantagesLooking down on IT and thinking they get paid for doing nothing : Railways and Space Tech was funded by British empire and NAZI Germany respectively. Both collapsed but doesn‚Äôt mean Tech disappeared, it thrived. Similary, even if $ collapses, IT & AI will thrive as it provides value to customers. (Ex: ease of booking railway ticket in your cellphone instead of going to Railway office)AI Replacing those jobs means those jobs were useless : Trucks and Trains replace bullock carts, it doesn't mean bulls were useless for last 10000 years and fed free food. Since AI is advancing it's replacing BPO jobs but it doesn't mean BPO employees don't work hard and were getting paid free moneyLinking Everything to De-dollarization like Dot Com bubble: Dot com bubble collapsed due to valuations hitting over 90 times earnings. (It‚Äôs 30 times now). Markets collapse every 5 years in US, why put De-dollarization everywhere. Even if Euro was not formed NASDAQ would have collapsed.","{'comment_id': 't1_n5ekp8k', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/Ankitshahgeopolitics/comments/1mae0ja/comment/n5ekp8k/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'I can‚Äôt read the whole thing but here are some key points I have:we hardly have unique thinkers in the RW scene.

Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, CBDCs are state-backed, offering both digital convenience and institutional reliability.What Are CBDCs?CBDCs are digital forms of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. They‚Äôre not just virtual cash ‚Äî they're a bridge between the legacy banking system and a tech-driven future. According to theBank for International Settlements (BIS), over130 countries, representing98% of global GDP, are currently exploring CBDCs.Trust: The Core of CBDC AdoptionSo, how do CBDCs build trust?Transparency:Every transaction is traceable, reducing fraud and money laundering.Security:Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) adds a tamper-resistant layer.Stability:Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are pegged to national currencies.For example, thee-CNY(China‚Äôs digital yuan) already has260 million usersand processed over1.8 trillion yuan($250 billion) in transactions by mid-2024 ‚Äî showing strong public acceptance.Benefits That Win Over the MassesCBDCs bring in a suite of advantages:Financial inclusion:People without bank accounts can access digital money via smartphones.Faster transactions:Real-time payments across borders reduce remittance costs.Reduced costs:Governments can cut down cash printing and distribution expenses.TheIMFreports that CBDCs can reduce payment costs byup to 90%, especially in developing economies.Challenges Still in PlayNo doubt, there‚Äôs more work to do:Privacy concerns:Citizens worry about surveillance through digital trails.Infrastructure readiness:Not all nations have the tech backbone yet.Interoperability issues:CBDCs must work seamlessly across borders and systems.What‚Äôs Next for CBDCs?With rising digital adoption and government initiatives, CBDCs are gearing up to become mainstream. Central banks are investing heavily in pilot projects and public education to build trust and ensure smooth transitions.FAQsQ: Are CBDCs the same as cryptocurrencies?Nope! CBDCs are government-backed and regulated, while most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and volatile.Q: Can CBDCs improve global payments?Absolutely. They‚Äôre designed for faster, cheaper, and secure transactions ‚Äî even across borders.Wrapping Up: A Future Fueled by TrustCentral Bank Digital Currencies aren‚Äôt just another tech trend ‚Äî they‚Äôre reshaping trust in financial systems.

Actually by the end of Biden\'s term it was well on its way to deconstructing LGBT civil rights entirely, which it did from the opposition.> \xa0and making the same mistake of reacting to every little thing and gesture Trump does as if the world will end.Trump frequently does a kind of cheap negotiating tactic - he will blow up a deal in the 11th hour, and use the panic this creates to leverage more concessions. Democrats are incapable of seeing this unfortunately in a lot of cases. His 11th hour ultimatum will cause totally outrage and panic. That\'s because this is what it\'s designed to do obviously - the whole goal is to put someone in an emotional state where they probably aren\'t thinking as rationally, they\'ll just be relieved when he ""comes to the rescue"" and suddenly offers terms that are acceptable.Democrats do *bad* in these negotiations because we frequently fall entirely for the con - when he announces the ultimatum, we gnash our teeth, it\'s the end of the world. This is exactly of course where he wants you in this, he wants you to panic. If Democrats could control their emotions better they would do much better in these negotiations. We Democrats are generally pretty nice and well behaved, we follow the rules, we don\'t just sort of vibe and do power plays. Unfortunately when you\'re dealing with a certain kind of predatory person, you\'ve got to throw any rulebook, be willing to make  strategic use of bad faith, and rely on heuristics.If you follow procedure, you will be predictable, and you will lose. As well, bad faith becomes necessary. A couple of reasons off the dome:You will often want to answer them obliquely, so as to limit your exposure - if you answer them directly, what will happen is that you will often wind up unveiling key critical facts in your argument that reveal your actual interests. And after the predatory person knows your actual interests, then those actual interests become bits of leverage he can use to extract additional concessions. With careful phrasing you can often rebut their point without introducing new facts to the conversation, and thus avoid accidentally giving them leverage.It is frequently useful to argue with an argument that is not actually your own? For one, often arguments from positions you don\'t actually believe can be more convincing than your actual argument. As well, since it\'s not actually your own argument, you\'re not actually providing leverage. If he mistakenly thinks you are, you can just pull back and be like meh, I didn\'t actually believe that anyway. You have thus trolled them, you have ""won"". This is bad sportmanship in a proper debate, against a predator who is just freeform spitting, you have to use tricks.Unfortunately, there is always the odd situation where Trump just dumps some insane ultimatum on you, and it turns out he was serious. Part of the reason he engages in this whole behavior is to make these situations ambiguous. When the enemy is just issuing a challenge, you might overreact and take it entirely seriously. On the other hand, if he\'s entire serious this time, you might be complacent due to all the other false alarms. The ambiguity is, again, intentional.> Maybe Trump fucks things up enough that it hurts some people and the GOP loses bigly in the midterms, but it will be because people are fed up with the Republicans, not because they like the Democrats.Winning is winning tho.', 'replies': []}]}]}]}",2025-08-04T01:33:08.750155,"['Hopeful', 'Misinformation: Crypto is not the only legal digital currency.', 'Trump blocked CBDCs, potentially favoring crypto adoption.']","['Neutral', 'None', ""Media's unsure crypto coverage leads to underreporting of Trump's actions in the space.""]","['Speculative', 'Misleading claim about privatization of currency issuance to crypto.', 'Comment speculates about Trump undermining USD in favor of crypto.']","['Positive', 'None', 'Crypto good; bot made comment; contact mods with concerns.']","['Neutral', 'None', 'Asks for explanation of CBDC and potential downsides.']","['Negative', 'None', 'Plan has a fatal flaw: currency undoing discourages investment.']"

Transfers are as fast and simple as Interac, with the added benefit that it makes zero difference where the recipient resides. Fees are also comparably cheap (or substantially cheaper in the case of cross-border tx) *IF* you use a blockchain that's focussed on transactional efficiency, which is to say, not Bitcoin. On the other hand, payments (excluding direct p2p transfers), while not inconvenientper se, tend to be less convenient than purchases with a credit card, Google Pay, etc, because most retailers use intermediary payment processors that require an extra minute or two of confirmation time for the tx.In other words, Interac is great for most purposes, but there can be practical benefits to crypto that make it a solid choice in some cases, irrespective of one's ideological position on banks/centralization more generally.

Trump‚Äôs CBDC Ban: Crypto Outshines Banks,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptomus/comments/1k1ez6c/trumps_cbdc_ban_crypto_outshines_banks/,r/cryptomus,2025-04-17T15:02:21.176000+0000,1,0,"On January 23, 2025, Donald Trump signed what may be the boldest financial order of the decade ‚Äî banning federal agencies from issuing or implementing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States. Why is this being called a turning point for the crypto market? What future now awaits decentralized assets in America and beyond? In this article, we break it down ‚Äî from the essence of the ban to its real-world impact and the new reality taking shape for cryptocurrencies.The New Era of DecentralizationCentral Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a new form of money issued directly by governments. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they are centralized, traceable, and programmable‚Äîallowing authorities to monitor transactions in real time. CBDCs quickly gained global traction as a response to the rise of crypto markets and the demand for modern payment solutions, with dozens of countries actively developing their own digital currencies.Against this backdrop, the U.S. took a different path. On January 23, 2025, Donald Trump signed one of the most controversial and consequential financial orders in recent memory ‚Äî restricting federal agencies from developing or implementing CBDCs.The ban on CBDCs removes government control from financial systems, paving the way for decentralized currencies. Unlike centralized digital currencies, where every transaction is under government surveillance, decentralized assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins allow users to make transactions without intermediaries or external interference. This provides more freedom and protection from censorship, as no one can simply block your funds or halt a transaction in such systems.Donald Trump's order is a major blow to the financial monopoly of traditional banks. Central banks will have to rethink their role in the financial ecosystem and explore ways to integrate crypto solutions, or risk losing control over a portion of their clients' assets. For crypto users, this signals that decentralized assets are now a legitimate alternative to traditional financial services. The age of crypto has arrived, and it shows no signs of slowing down.Trump‚Äôs Executive Order: A Turning Point in RegulationBut the story didn‚Äôt stop there. Just days later, a new federal working group was launched to design a comprehensive regulatory framework for decentralized assets. Led by representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Federal Reserve, the group was tasked with one goal ‚Äî to rethink the place of crypto in the American financial system. The reaction was immediate: trust in decentralized networks surged, Bitcoin rallied, and the role of non-custodial wallets entered a new phase of relevance.How the CBDC Ban is Reshaping the Financial MarketThe ban on CBDCs and the growing interest in decentralized assets are sparking a financial revolution. More and more people are turning to decentralized wallets and platforms, which offer freedom and privacy in transactions. Banks, feeling the pressure of competition, are quickly integrating crypto solutions, developing their own blockchain platforms, and rolling out new products like stablecoins to keep up with trends and retain customers.In this new reality, cryptocurrencies are becoming accessible to everyone, offering an alternative to traditional banking services. Payments and transfers without intermediaries, the ability to engage in P2P trading, and instant transactions are all making the financial system more flexible and accessible. Banks can no longer be the sole providers of financial services in this rapidly evolving landscape.So, Donald Trump's ban on CBDCs marks a significant step toward promoting financial alternatives, positioning cryptocurrencies as a competitive force alongside traditional banking methods.

This innovative experiment, dubbed Project Hangang, will involve 100,000 participants and run for a thrilling three months, providing a first-hand look at CBDCs in action.Imagine converting your regular bank deposits into digital tokens that can be used for everyday purchases. Thanks to this pilot, participants will be able to buy goodies from well-known merchants like 7-Eleven and Ediya Coffee, all with a simple QR code scan through their banking apps. Just think of swipe-to-shop convenience! Each person can have up to 1 million won (about $690), with a total limit of 5 million won during the pilot.This initiative is a collaborative effort between seven major South Korean banks, designed to simplify payment processes and reduce transaction costs. The goal? To discover if CBDCs can streamline current banking setups and bring about more efficient transactions.As noted by the Bank of Korea, this testing phase builds on prior research and marks a significant move towards integrating CBDCs into our daily lives. Not only does this align South Korea with global CBDC trends, but it also positions the nation as a frontrunner in real-world applications of digital currencies.Could this be a stepping stone towards a future where $BTC, $ETH, and other digital assets become commonplace in retail?

Even across central bank studies and pilots, the form differs. BIS and the Swedish and Danish central banks should have quite some literature on it.If it iscash on a card, there are differences compared to traditional banks. It is de factofull-reserve, doesn't pay out interest, and is not (necessarily) connected to a personal account. It can't be used for the purposes of money creation and can be accessed at any time.Depending on the form you could transfer from your card anonymously to other peoples' cards or devices. Likely, we require some form of traditional clearing, in which case the data for that card needs to be stored somewhere centrally, even if it isn't inherently linked to a person. In cases where this would not be necessary, it truly functions as cash.I think an important change on the consumer side would be that CBDC is aimed at promoting financial inclusion while not needing the infrastructure of cash. Card payments are increasingly common, resulting in reduced cash infrastructure, which may make access to money complicated for, for example, the elderly in low population-density areas, who prefer cash over card but have less and less easy access to cash infrastructure.

Nigeria, Jamaica and the Bahamas have already launched central bank digital currency (CBDC) and a further 44 countries, including Russia, China and Brazil are running pilots, according to the Atlantic Council think tank.Trump, by contrast, prohibited the U.S. Federal Reserve from issuing its own CBDC.Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have garnered significant attention and debate among policymakers, economists, and the public. Here are some of the main points of critique against CBDCs:Privacy Concerns: CBDCs could enable central banks to track all transactions made by individuals, leading to concerns about surveillance and a loss of financial privacy. This centralization of transaction data could be exploited for monitoring and control.Financial Inclusion vs. Exclusion: While proponents argue that CBDCs can enhance financial inclusion, there is a risk that those without access to technology or digital literacy may be left behind. In regions with limited internet or tech infrastructure, CBDCs could exacerbate existing inequalities.Disruption of Commercial Banks: CBDCs could disrupt the traditional banking system, potentially leading to disintermediation. If consumers hold CBDCs directly with central banks, it could reduce the deposit base of commercial banks, which may affect their ability to lend and manage liquidity.Monetary Policy Implications. The introduction of a CBDC could complicate the implementation of monetary policy. For example, if a CBDC is seen as a substitute for bank deposits, it could lead to sudden shifts in banking dynamics that central banks might not be able to control effectively.Cybersecurity Risks: Digital currencies are inherently vulnerable to cyberattacks. The centralization of a CBDC system could present a high-value target for hackers, posing risks to financial stability and consumer trust.Technological Accessibility. The implementation of a CBDC relies on widespread access to technology, which may not be fully available in all demographics or geographical areas. This raises questions about equity and accessibility.Transition and Implementation Challenges: Developing a CBDC entails significant infrastructure investment and technological changes. The transition from traditional currencies to digital currencies could be complex and costly.Economic Structure Concerns: Critics worry that CBDCs could lead to greater centralization of financial systems, undermining the diversity and competitiveness that exist in today's financial landscape.Potential for Unintended Consequences: The introduction of CBDCs may have unforeseen impacts on consumer behavior, savings rates, and lending practices that could destabilize the economy.Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Establishing a CBDC raises a multitude of legal and regulatory issues, including how it fits into existing financial regulatory frameworks and how it will interact with cryptocurrencies.These critiques highlight the complexity of implementing CBDCs and the need for thorough consideration of their potential impacts on society, the economy, and the financial system.","{'comment_id': 't1_mbi0eu6', 'upvote': 3, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/europeanunion/comments/1ijwdyq/comment/mbi0eu6/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""I'm emigrating if this gets rolled out.Listen to Richard Werners take on this.

FYI, the USA is just getting chips in their credit cards lol.It is good that the government is rolling out many options for the public to deploy their finances with - be it cash, bank products, personal wallets (UPI) and now digital currency.It prevents monopoly of any single method and by extension also prevents monopoly of any institution. If it is just a cash economy, there\'s a risk of counterfeit currency. If it\'s a bank-controlled economy, the customer will end up paying so much fees and charges for every small thing. A UPI-based economy, and the government corporation (NPCI) gets a monopoly.It is best for the consumer to have as many options as possible.(For those too naive to understand: I\'ll draw an analogy. Imagine a world where there\'s no cars. Only autos - well, these auto drivers are gonna rip you off - because they know you don\'t have any other options. Similarly, imagine a world with only taxis. Same situation. Imagine a world with only Uber and Ola. Again, same. Imagine a world with only private cars - now, the manufacturers are gonna rip you off.It is best for you to have multiple options.

So here‚Äôs a rejoinder.Digital Rupee will exist only virtually. It has no physical form.You can‚Äôt withdraw it from bank in the form of physical currency notes.The only way you can use it is by spending it virtually using an online system like UPISo govt knows everything you ever use your money on.You can‚Äôt withdraw that money and spend it privately without letting anyone k ow where you spent it.Government wants to nano-manage your spending habits.NOW COMES THE WORST SCENARIOSSpecific purpose digital rupee: Since everything is digital, govt now links money to specific purpose. This is already happening. Govt is planning to give urea subsidies to farmers as digital rupees which can only be used for urea purchases.Imagine your employer giving you your salary with purpose-linked digital rupee.

RBI is piloting an eRupee. Here's a fun read about how this plays into the banking system,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/zi28ll/rbi_is_piloting_an_erupee_heres_a_fun_read_about/,r/IndiaInvestments,2022-12-10T20:13:24.116000+0000,413,127,"First published this on my newsletter Boring Money. Do visit the original link and subscribe if you like read this! I write about finance in India in a way that's fun and enjoyable but doesn't dumb down the subject matter. Finance can be fun!https://boringmoney.substack.com/p/rbi-cbdc-erupee--A quirky aspect of modern financial systems is that it is incredibly difficult to hold cash ascash. Sure, you could withdraw ‚Çπ10,000 ($120) and keep it in your wallet. But make that ‚Çπ10 crores ($1.2 million) and the only acceptable way to store this cash is in shady suitcases. Possible, yes, but extremely inconvenient.The way modern financial systems work is that any money you deposit in your bank account is no longercashbut an obligation. From the bank to you. You‚Äôre really loaning money to your bank in return for which the bank pays you some interest. Your bank then uses your deposits to make loans toitscustomers and gets some interest from them. There is obviously a risk here, even if small. If the bank‚Äôs customers don‚Äôt pay back, your deposits could be at risk. Your bankcouldgo bust. It‚Äôs the regulator‚Äôs, the RBI‚Äôs, job to ensure this doesn‚Äôt happen. And if it does happen, to figure a workaround‚Äîbut it could definitely happen1Which is why, in theory, money as deposits in your bank differs from cash in your hand. Physical cash is also an obligation‚Äîbut from the RBI to you. Even if all banks went bust, RBI‚Äôs promise to you would still stand and you can get your money‚Äôs worth2.All of this is fascinating but also pointless in any well-functioning financial system. Scheduled banks in India aren‚Äôt going bust overnight. And when they‚Äôve done, the RBI has handled the situationreasonably welland customershaven‚Äôt lost money. For all practical purposes, having that digit show up in your bank account is as good as holding physical cash in your hand. Just a lot more convenient!If you‚Äôve kept up with the news the last month and half, you‚Äôd know that the RBI isnow piloting ways to storecashdigitally. It calls this the eRupee or e‚Çπ, a digital form of the rupee itself. This differs from money in your bank account in the manner that I described above. If you have ‚Çπ100 in your bank account and convert it to e‚Çπ1003this is what happens behind the scenes:Your bank opens its ledger and deletes its debt obligation to you (deposits are loans from you to the bank!)The bank digs out its stash of eRupees that it‚Äôs stored on a hard disk somewhere. The RBI has given the bank ‚ÄúeRupees‚Äù just as it gives the bank physical rupeesBank hands over the eRupees to you in your e-wallet! Just like it does with cash. The bank has nothing to do with your money now and your relationship is directly with the RBI, who has ‚Äúprinted‚Äù these eRupeesAgain, if you‚Äôre in a sound financial system, you don‚Äôt really care if you have cash or a debt obligation from a bank. The RBI is finding it difficult to answer why the eRupee is needed when nearly instantaneous digital payments already exist. FromBloomberg Quint:The e-rupee, India's CBDC, will distinguish itself from the UPI in the way transactions move between two parties, according to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das. While the UPI involves the movement of funds between two bank accounts, the CBDC will instead move funds from one party's wallet‚Äîon their mobile phone‚Äîto the other's, he said.""There is no routing, and there is no intermediation by the bank,"" Das said during the press conference after the monetary policy announcement. While banks will issue the CBDC to the users, they won't be involved in the transaction, as opposed to the UPI, which requires the transmission of messages between the payment platforms and banks.""E-rupee is money. UPI is a payment method,"" said Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar. It's possible for two private parties to provide wallets, and money can move between those, he said, adding that it wouldn't be possible using the UPI. ""We'll set up the base system, and then the private sector can innovate.""‚ÄúE-rupee is money. UPI is a payment method,‚Äù‚Ä¶ umm, okay. If I‚Äôm waiting in line waiting to buy apple juice, should I care?Incentives, utility, or neither?If you‚Äôre a bank, what you care about most is getting your customers to deposit money (that is, loan you money). You pay them a small interest and in turn lend out money for a much higher interest rate. That‚Äôs your entire business model. Ideally, your customers would just put tons of money and let it sit there untouched.But that‚Äôs far from what customers want from banks‚Äîthey also want to transfer money around to pay for stuff. Which is fine! If you make it easy and seamless for your customers to make and receive payments, it‚Äôs a good thing. Your customers will be moving money across banks but the money will beinsidethe system. If one of your customer is paying someone from another bank, then there‚Äôs another receiving money. At the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt matter because it evens out. The money‚Äôs in the system!With the eRupee, that changes. Customers can make payments back-and-forth without banks coming into the picture. This isn‚Äôt good for banks‚Äîthey need those deposits to be in the system!But also, what‚Äôs in it for the customer? If I can buy my apple juice without visiting an ATM‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs good enough for me?Something that keeps coming up when the RBI speaks about the benefits of the eRupee is that it will help with financial inclusion. The story goes that holding money digitally is good and convenient. But no matter how hard everyone tries a large chunk of India‚Äôs population wants little to do with banks and continues using cash.It‚Äôs hard to imagine a scenario where people who‚Äôve been averse to bank accounts suddenly decide to lose their inhibition to technology and financial systems because‚Ä¶ the money in your bank account is a debt obligation while the eRupee comes directly from the RBI. People who like cash like itbecauseit‚Äôs not digital. Cash is nice to touch, feel, and hold. You can stash it in your wallet or inside your mattress, if that‚Äôs your thing. It‚Äôs not a number on your screen that can disappear with an accidental press of a button.Of course, others like cash not because it‚Äôs nice to hold but because it‚Äôs difficult to trace4. I don‚Äôt even mean like terrorists and stuff. Small businesses love cash because it lets them get away from paying tax. Would the eRupee allow people to commit tax fraud? I feel that this is an important use-case that the RBI needs to replicate with the eRupee if it wants adoption. ‚ÄúCommit tax fraud, just do it digitally!‚Äù sounds like a good pitch5.If you liked reading this do visit the original link and subscribe!https://boringmoney.substack.com/p/rbi-cbdc-erupee","{'comment_id': 't1_izpfqhm', 'upvote': 54, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/zi28ll/comment/izpfqhm/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': ""Do you foresee the erupee replace physical notes in the future, perhaps in cities?

I've also been away on vacation for a bit and it looks like a lot has happened so I still need to update what I have here but I hope this provides some insight into what may be happening.None of this is meant to serve as prophecy or financial advice. I'm not advocating for anything. This is strictly just information. Feel free to fact check it.How is this relevant?

This throws some of the landscape into question.FromThe International Monetary System\'. Forty Years After Bretton Woods- Proceedings of a Conference Held in May 1984 Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of BostonIn spite of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, the United States was not really on a gold standard. The essence of the gold standard is that the money supply must be limited by the gold reserve.The last time that the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy because the gold reserve ratio fell close to the legal minimum was in March 1933. Since then, whenever the gold reserve neared the legal minimum, the required reserve ratio was reduced and finally eliminated entirely.A country that loses more than half of its gold reserve, as the United States did in 1958-71, without reducing the money supply is not on the gold standard.What happened in August 1971 was the abandonment of the anomoly of dollar convertibility into gold when the United States was not on a gold standard.Just want to emphasize this. 1971 was a late political acknowledgement (a leftoveranomaly/artifact to be cleaned up). The US was not on a gold standard (and arguably wasn\'t even before 1933)....and now onto global monetary expansionwithout central bank/US Gov\'t involvement.The pressures causing some currencies persistently to strengthen, and others to weaken, in response to their differences in economic performance, were exacerbated by the unusual dependence on the dollar.For from the early sixties onward there was virtually no control over the worldwide supply and use of dollars.The ""dollar shortage"" of the fifties was becoming the ""dollar glut"" of the sixties.The ""eurodollar"" or ""shadow banking"" system arose by the 1950s. It\'s really just a wholesale global banking market dealing in USD. By the 60s, banks in the US were increasingly borrowing from offshore vs. obtaining ""funding"" from the Fed. Offshore funding allowed banks to bypass restrictions (like reserve requirements).It appeared impossible for the United States to maintain effective control over the supply of dollars at home and abroad simply by following the old rules of the gold standard game--i.e., by maintaining a surplus in its external current accounts.The urgent needs for capital expansion around the world attracted the expertise of rapidly developing multinational companies, many of them based in the United States, and all of them drawing on additional (global) dollars to finance their desired growth.Capital outflows from the United States, spurred by direct investment from within andsubstantial borrowings from without, began to flood the world with an apparent excess of dollar liquidity-despite the absorption of liquidity that might have been expected from the large current account surplus of the United States.Central banks abroad found themselves with what became an ""overhang"" of dollars in their foreign exchange reserves.There are numerous examples of Fed chairs lamenting their inability to even measure the money supply. Other countries realized thatprivate sector generatedUSD funding had taken off. An ""Overhang"" in exchange reserves is a mild way to put it.One improvisation after another was attempted in order to preserve or restore confidence in the credibility of the dollar as a reliable standard of value and medium of exchange capable of assuring stability in the payments relations throughout an expanding world.A""""gold pool"" among leading central banks, initiation of a ""ring of swaps"" between the dollar and a dozen or more other currencies, creation of U.S. dollar obligations denominated in foreign currencies, the introduction of an Interest Equalization Tax and other measures to deter capital outflows--all these were part of an effort to sustain the dollar while also building a network of closer joint involvement with other countries in maintaining currency arrangements that could serve the best interests of all.But this combination of improvisations could not cope with, and indeed may have contributed to, the enormous expansion in markets for U.S. dollars offshore, and thenew networks of interbank relationsthatmade possible the creation of additional supplies of dollars outside the United States and beyond the control of the Federal Reserve.Why do central banks hold gold? Originally, to ""back"" notes, but later just to appear to still be in charge of their denominations.These ""tricks"", including swap lines, etc... have been largelyineffective, and may have exacerbated the ""problem"" (the shift of monetary control to the global banking sector).New networks of interbank relations(interconnected global banks) creating dollars beyond the control of a central bank.....Now, when global dollar liquidity is low; trading partners would beexpectedto find other means of settlement (BRICS, direct settlement in other denominations without relying on the global dollar system).Just a thought... Either way, moving away from the dollar due to geopolitical tension.. or lack of dollar liquidity.. or a combination of both.', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_jexby1d', 'upvote': 3, 'depth': 1, 'permalink': '/r/Bitcoin/comments/12bioxw/comment/jexby1d/', 'parent_id': 't1_jex7wke', 'comment_body': 'Awesome, thanks for that insight!', 'replies': []}, {'comment_id': 't1_jexicn7', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 1, 'permalink': '/r/Bitcoin/comments/12bioxw/comment/jexicn7/', 'parent_id': 't1_jex7wke', 'comment_body': 'thank you', 'replies': []}]}","{'comment_id': 't1_jexd0qr', 'upvote': 9, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/Bitcoin/comments/12bioxw/comment/jexd0qr/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'I genuinely thought this was going to be a shitpost but‚Ä¶this is actually quite interesting.

India has quitely launched it's CBDC for limited use and I got to use it,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14io5qb/india_has_quitely_launched_its_cbdc_for_limited/,r/CryptoCurrency,2023-06-25T14:50:14.080000+0000,85,160,"Currently they're rolling out this feature for limited access and my bank gave me access to this too.So basically they have made ""cash"" digital. The Reserve Bank of India(RBI) has launched a back end interface that currently the large banks are integrating their front end interfaces with to make new apps. When we open the app, we need to register with our phone number and then we have a wallet in the app. Nothing about private keys (asfaik). The app shows denominations of different physical coins and notes (they look a bit different though) and we can select how much of each denomination we want to have in our wallet.Once we're done selecting for example - 2x ‚Çπ5 notes and 4x ‚Çπ100 notes, we can enter our bank details so that they can deduct the same from our bank account. Once it's in the wallet, each note(they say token) has a different unique number in them and when we send it to someone else who has to have a wallet, they'll get the token with that same unique number( idk what they call that number). We can send it to people having a phone number registered with this system or a QR code from the same.And RBI has said for the time being that they won't be tracking the transactions which aren't large or of transactions involving large denominations ( I don't have clarity about which they talked about).They have also made a system where we if he have for example a ‚Çπ500 denomination token only and we want to send Mr.X ‚Çπ400, we type in ‚Çπ400 and send it the person, the intermediary bank will take the ‚Çπ500 token from me, give me back a ‚Çπ100 token and give the receiver 2x ‚Çπ200 tokens.RBI has also said that they would link this system with the existing Unified Payments Interface(UPI) which is a widely used system to transfer money up to an amount of ‚Çπ0.1 million(in most cases) for free through banks. When this gets integrated, we can send money from and to the wallet from bank accounts which are not linked, and this everyone would not need to open wallets for themselves. The bank (who is the intermediary over here) would collect the tokens and credit the person who wants it in his bank account with the normal money we have in our banks.I couldn't find an article to link but I have used this and we might get articles about it in the near future.Here's a YouTube video explaining all of it really nicely if you want to know more-https://youtu.be/kyYsed1Yd6EEdit: My dumbass forgot to mention its name.

In most exchanges like coinDCX the balance will be owned centralised basically the crypto you own will be just shown to you and you won't be able to even withdraw or send it somewhere else.Now in Binance you can actually withdraw your BTC to a wallet.Now what is a wallet? Wallet is basically a place where your BTC is actually your BTC, it is not store in centralised way and you are responsible for it, no one can force you to sell it no one can steal it.

A simple guide to getting into crypto!,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1h2o851/a_simple_guide_to_getting_into_crypto/,r/CryptoIndia,2024-11-29T15:28:21.460000+0000,65,42,"A lot of people want to get into crypto and have lot of questions. I am creating this simple guide to make it easy for them.DecentralizationAt the time crypto currencies were conceived they were not designed to be investment instruments. This holds true even now for major pureplay currencies like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Monero. They aim to serve as the currencies of the decentralized world.Decentralization simply means eliminating single points of failure which really means eliminating hierarchy. Mukesh Ambani and his family members run Reliance Group. They are very rich (inheritance) but a majority of their employees like the Jio Supermarket staff are very poor. This is because the lower level employees have no say in determining salaries. In a centralized systems not everyone is equal. On the other hand, no one runs Monero. Anyone can mine Monero on a laptop or mobile (though it may not always be profitable to do so). No one owns large amounts of Monero.Monero practices ungovernance - which means no government can be good, so why bother? It is open to all. No one even wants to know your name. No question of any discrimination based on age, gender, nationality, religion, caste and qualification.Some other blockchain projects believe in collective governance like Ethereum. They are like company and sometimes they may seize your funds. Search the internet about DAO project and how it lead to the creation of Ethereum Classic. Many projects have some form of governance. They are called proof of stake currencies. Some projects pretend to be proof of work but have some form of governance or token allocation or premine or ICO. We cannot consider them pure proof of work.The four major currencies which aim to practice ungovernance are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Monero. These four are proof of work (PoW) currencies. However, Monero is more decentralized than others.Buying the four major currenciesThe four major currencies - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Monero are your ticket to the decentralized world. They don't care for rules and they are open. Anyone can buy or sell them. It doesn't matter if you are three year old or a bot, a criminal or a saint.Bisq - Bitcoin's decentralized exchange. You can buy/sell Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin using INR.Haveno - Monero's decentralized exchange. You can buy/sell Monero using INR.WalletsYou will need wallets to store your crypto. You must NEVER keep your crypto on an exchange. Always store your crypto in self-custodial wallets. For Bitcoin, use Muun wallet, for Bitcoin Cash, use Cake wallet, for Litecoin, use Litewallet and for Monero, you can use Monero.com by Cake wallet or Monerujo. Carefully note down your seed phrase/keys. Never lose them. Never share it with anyone. For long term storage, you can just make a note of your seed phrase and keys and delete the wallet from your phone/computer. When you do this, it becomes a paper wallet.Which payment method should you use to buy crypto?Cash at ATM - Buyer deposits money into the seller's account at a branch or ATM.Cash by Mail - Buyer wraps cash in dark brown paper, puts it in a dark colored envelope and mails it to the address provided by the seller (usually a post box or business address).How to store your seed phrase/keysDigital - Create a password protected pdf or a password protected zip file with the seed phrase and keys. Store this on multiple devices like a sturdy metallic pen drive, a computers hard drive, old phone etc. These devices must NOT be connected to the internet.Paper - You can make a note of your seed phrase and keys on paper or engrave it on a steel plate and bury it in a box at a place that only you can access.How do we make money in crypto?Forget about Rupees and USDT if you want to succeed. Your aim should be to earn more Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Monero. Everything else will fall into place.Right now these four currencies are growing in value but that is not what they are designed for. So ideally you cannot ""invest"" in these currencies. You can trade their futures if you are good in math, disciplined and good at learning things by yourself. Or, you can invest by finding opportunities on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana who are trying to create economies of scale and have many good projects which you can invest in. You can also mine crypto, stake crypto and hunt for airdrops.Trading and InvestingBitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Monero are volatile with respect to each other. Sometimes Bitcoin rises in value against Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Monero. Sometimes Bitcoin Cash rises or falls sharply against Litecoin and Monero. Traders, like me, typically hold two or more of these four currencies. When Bitcoin Cash is rising, we convert our BTC/LTC/XMR into BCH. Once we make some gains, we swap back to BTC/LTC/XMR. This increases our holding. When BCH starts to go down, we switch to BTC or XMR. This is one way to earn more crypto.The second way to trade is to use a service like BCHbull where you can create a time bound BCH trading contract against Rupees, Dollars, Gold, Silver etc.Third option is to invest in projects which might deliver exponential growth. I like to avoid this because you will need to constantly follow what's happening with the project. Whenever you feel the urge to do this, remember, crypto currencies are not investment instruments.Fourth is to trade futures on decentralized exchanges like Jupiter. Ethereum's L2 solution Arbitrum has many derivatives exchanges where you can trade crypto futures as well as gold, silver, crude oil etc. An example of such an exchange is Gains.trade.What is the meaning of market rising or falling?Decentralists don't worry about Rupees and USDT. From our perspective, a rising market means a falling BTC dominance index and a falling market means a rising BTC dominance index. You can base your trades on this, using a service like BCHbull.Where to get your first crypto?Bisq and Haveno ask for security deposit. So you need some crypto first. India has millions of crypto investors. You might know someone. Buy it from them. If that doesn't work for you - mine some Verus coins on your phone, play some crypto airdrop games on Telegram or just beg. Dogecoin community has a Reddit sub for it - /Dogecoinbeg.How can I learn more?The first book you should read is ""The Bitcoin Standard"". After you have read it, go for ""Mastering Monero"". If you want to learn trading, a good book is ""The Art of Currency Trading"". Remember, the four major currencies are currencies. They are not stocks. They don't have any kind of intrinsic value. You trade currencies based on events that may influence demand/supply with respect to other currencies. An example is a Fed rate cut. So don't come with a stock market mindset. In addition to these books you can read the docs that were created by early decentralist thinkers like Satoshi Nakamoto.Don't engage in unmindful activitiesA governance free world doesn't mean we engage in any kind of unlawful activities. Practice non-violence. Don't cheat or steal from others. Don't incite hatred. Don't discriminate. If you do any of these, you will likely get into serious trouble.Do Your Own ResearchThere will be people who will say such and such memecoin or project will do 100x. There will be people who will say you can't make money in BTC, BCH, LTC and XMR. There is no right or wrong. As a general rule, remind yourself that crypto currencies are NOT investment instruments. Prepare your strategy and stick to it. To make a successful strategy you need to research thoroughly. Start at CoinMarketCap. Study the top 100 cryptos by market cap. Study must involve - visiting their website (to know about the project), comparing it with other similar projects, reading the community's views on Reddit/Telegram/Discord (this will give you many insights into how things are actually playing out). Don't put your money into anything without doing this.If you have questions, ask! Someone will answer.Best of luck!","{'comment_id': 't1_lzklnd3', 'upvote': 7, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1h2o851/comment/lzklnd3/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'best ever post made on this sub thanks for this G', 'replies': []}","{'comment_id': 't1_lzkyq08', 'upvote': 3, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1h2o851/comment/lzkyq08/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'which is best decentralised exchange to buy crypto', 'replies': [{'comment_id': 't1_lzkz9ls', 'upvote': 3, 'depth': 1, 'permalink': '/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1h2o851/comment/lzkz9ls/', 'parent_id': 't1_lzkyq08', 'comment_body': 'You can buy crypto using INR on Bisq and Haveno.

How to disclose crypto assets in ITR?,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaTax/comments/1idp9h8/how_to_disclose_crypto_assets_in_itr/,r/IndiaTax,2025-01-30T15:19:25.529000+0000,4,13,I am in unusual position. So for details- i bought some crypto on binance and vauld in 2021 during that crypto hype if you remember.After that binance got caught in regulatatory problem with indian government and was not accessible and vauld got bankrupt.So i made peace with my losses.Government also made rules for crypto (like 30% tax on profits ) in 2022.Last year in 2024 binance reopened by complying with indian government. And i can access my binance crypto account. Its unrealised worth is 850usd at preseent against 28000inr investment in 2021.So my doubt is 1) am i in wrong by not disclosing this purchase in 2021 itr? (In my defence government also didnt have any clue about this in 2021 and as binance closed i thought disclosing it in that itr seemed irrelevant that time. And i know i was wrong.)2)How can i disclose this asset in next itr.How to proceed?,"{'comment_id': 't1_ma14vum', 'upvote': 4, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/IndiaTax/comments/1idp9h8/comment/ma14vum/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'Just declare it whenever you sell/transfer it.

The bank is now allowed to loan out most of that money.

Alice deposits the $100 in her bank. The bank is required to keep 10% of it on hand, but allowed to loan out 90% of it, which they do, to Bob, who now has $90 in cash, and the bank has $10 in physical cash, even though Alice still has the full $100 in her account according to the ledger.Bob now deposits his $90 in a bank, either the same one or a different one, which in turn backs a $90 * 90% = $81 loan to Carol. Carol's $81 backs a $72.90 loan to Dave, which backs a $65.61 loan, and so on, with the original $100 in cash turning into $1000 dollars in circulation across everyone's accounts.

And, in the modern world, that initial $100 probably isn't physical cash in the first place, but an entry in the bank's ledgers that the government authorized.

South Korea‚Äôs Central Bank Backs Gradual Stablecoin Launch,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinInsiderMagazine/comments/1lk51ux/south_koreas_central_bank_backs_gradual/,r/CoinInsiderMagazine,2025-06-25T13:01:05.811000+0000,2,0,"South Korea‚Äôs central bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), has called for a cautious and phased introduction of stablecoins in the country‚Äôs financial system.According to Yonhap News, BOK deputy governor Ryoo Sangdai stated that a won-backed stablecoin should be launched through regulated commercial banks to provide a secure foundation. Sangdai said, ‚ÄúIt would be desirable to initially allow stablecoin issuance primarily through banks, which are subject to higher levels of financial regulation, and gradually expand it to the non-banking sector.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThe aim is to establish a safety net, considering the potential for market disruption or consumer harm.‚ÄùThe proposal comes amid growing interest in blockchain-based digital finance and the global rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). According to a recent policy statement and interviews with senior officials, the BOK emphasised that stablecoins‚Äîcryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like the Korean won or US dollar‚Äîcould offer benefits such as faster payments and broader financial inclusion. However, they also present significant regulatory and monetary policy challenges.The bank stated that introducing stablecoins should be approached carefully, considering potential risks, including financial instability, privacy concerns, and undermining sovereign currency control. A senior BOK official noted that while innovation in financial technology is welcome, it must not come at the expense of regulatory clarity and consumer protection. The BOK is already running pilot programs for a CBDC, which could complement or compete with privately issued stablecoins. The central bank‚Äôs current stance aims to allow time for regulatory frameworks, technological infrastructure, and consumer readiness to catch up with the pace of innovation.A significant concern for the BOK is ensuring that any stablecoin framework aligns with South Korea‚Äôs existing financial regulations and international standards. The central bank emphasised collaborating with global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and other central banks to create interoperable and secure digital currency ecosystems. This approach mirrors actions taken by other jurisdictions, such as Japan, the European Union, and the United States, all in various stablecoin and CBDC development stages.South Korea‚Äôs strategy suggests that stablecoins could complement CBDCs, provided safeguards are in place to prevent misuse in illicit finance or disruptions to traditional banking systems. The BOK also expressed concern about tech companies or non-bank entities issuing stablecoins without appropriate oversight. The central bank warned that allowing such initiatives without stringent compliance checks could erode trust in the broader financial system and increase systemic risks.While acknowledging the efficiency gains that could be achieved through stablecoins, the BOK highlighted the delicate balance between fostering innovation and maintaining monetary stability. One of the central concerns is the potential for stablecoins to divert deposits away from commercial banks, which could reduce the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy tools.The BOK‚Äôs research indicates that widespread adoption of stablecoins, especially those issued by foreign entities or linked to non-Korean currencies, could diminish the effectiveness of the won as a unit of account and medium of exchange. To address this, the bank is considering stablecoins that are strictly backed 1:1 by the Korean won and issued under the supervision of licensed financial institutions.Consumer education, transparent reserve mechanisms, and real-time audibility were essential for any future stablecoin framework. As part of its broader digital currency initiative, the BOK will continue to test various technological solutions and gather public input through 2025.¬†South Korea‚Äôs central bank is not rejecting stablecoins but seeking a pragmatic path that aligns with national interests. Its preference for a gradual, well-regulated rollout reflects a growing global consensus: digital currencies have potential but must be introduced responsibly.Read the full article here ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://www.coininsider.com/news/2025/06/south-koreas-central-bank-backs-gradual-stablecoin-launch/",,,,,,2025-08-04T01:03:24.633677,"['Cautious', 'None', ""South Korea's central bank favors a gradual, regulated stablecoin launch through banks, prioritizing stability and consumer protection.""]","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']","['None', 'None', 'None']"

"The History of Monetary Control: Debt, Centralization, and Modern Enslavement",https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1kz3fjm/the_history_of_monetary_control_debt/,r/conspiracy,2025-05-30T12:51:52.127000+0000,2,1,"The evolution of monetary systems reveals a consistent pattern of centralized power structures using debt and currency manipulation to subjugate populations. From ancient debt bondage to modern digital surveillance, financial systems have served as tools for elite control rather than neutral mediums of exchange. This report synthesizes historical evidence and contemporary practices to demonstrate how monetary systems perpetuate systemic oppression.Ancient Babylon: The Birth of Debt as EnslavementWeaponized Debt in Mesopotamian Law Babylonian law codified debt slavery as a mechanism for social control. Under Hammurabi‚Äôs Code (circa 1750 BCE), debtors could pledge their wives, children, or slaves as mancipium, hostages forced to labor for creditors until debts were repaid. Creditors retained these individuals for up to three years, effectively institutionalizing intergenerational servitude. Distraint laws allowed creditors to seize crops, livestock, and property, but crucially prohibited arbitrary seizure of debtors‚Äô grain, revealing a system designed to maintain agricultural productivity while ensuring perpetual indebtedness.The Code‚Äôs provisions for debt relief were not benevolent but pragmatic. Rulers issued ""clean slate"" edicts during economic crises to prevent total societal collapse, yet these measures preserved the underlying debt-based hierarchy. As noted in Mesopotamian records, sharecroppers remained bound to land owned by elites, with interest penalties ensuring permanent dependency. This system mirrors modern austerity policies, where temporary relief perpetuates structural inequality.Rome‚Äôs Monetary Manipulation and Nexum Debt Bondage Through Legal ContractsRoman law formalized debt enslavement through nexum, a contract binding debtors to creditors through symbolic rituals involving copper weights and oaths. While scholars debate whether nexum represented voluntary indentured servitude or coercive bondage, its outcomes were clear: defaulting debtors forfeited citizenship rights, facing either execution or lifetime slavery. The Twelve Tables (451‚Äì450 BCE) institutionalized this brutality, permitting creditors to dismember debtors‚Äô bodies proportionally to unpaid debts, a physical manifestation of financial subjugation.Currency Debasement and Economic CollapseRome‚Äôs transition from silver denarii to debased coinage exemplifies elite exploitation of monetary systems. By reducing silver content from 95% to 5% over centuries, emperors funded military expansion while eroding public trust in currency. This inflationary tactic transferred wealth from citizens to the state, mirroring modern central banks‚Äô fiat currency policies. The resulting economic instability collapsed trade networks and concentrated resources among patrician classes, establishing a template for later financial elites.The Rothschild Dynasty and Central Banking War Financing and Central Bank CaptureThe Rothschild family‚Äôs 19th-century dominance over European war financing illustrates private control of public debt. During the Napoleonic Wars, Nathan Rothschild leveraged courier networks to manipulate bond markets, profiting from Britain‚Äôs victory at Waterloo. This established a model where banking dynasties could influence national policies through debt dependency. In the U.S., Rothschild agents reportedly provoked the War of 1812 to pressure Congress into renewing the First Bank of the United States‚Äô charter.The Federal Reserve: Unconstitutional Monetary ControlThe 1913 Federal Reserve Act created a privately owned central bank with unchecked authority over U.S. currency. Constitutional scholars argue the Fed‚Äôs structure violates Article II by insulating its leadership from presidential oversight, creating a ‚Äúfourth branch‚Äù of government accountable only to financial elites. The Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB precedent (2010) highlights this unconstitutionality, demonstrating how Federal Open Market Committee members operate beyond executive control. By monopolizing money creation, the Fed enriches private banks through interest-bearing debt instruments, a system where every dollar printed represents public obligation to private entities.Modern Financial Enslavement SystemsThe World Bank and IMF Debt Traps Low- and middle-income countries paid $1.4 trillion in foreign debt servicing during 2023, with interest costs consuming up to 38% of export earnings. The World Bank and IMF enforce austerity measures that prioritize creditor repayments over public welfare, exemplified by Kenya‚Äôs 2024 loan conditions requiring tax hikes while ignoring government corruption. These institutions function as colonial-era overseers, extracting resources through debt peonage disguised as development aid.Cryptocurrency and Programmable ControlDigital currencies promise decentralization but enable unprecedented surveillance. SURVEIL-X‚Äôs AI-driven cryptocurrency monitoring systems track semi-anonymous traders and automated bots, reconstructing transactions to infer intent. This technology paves the way for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) capable of freezing assets or restricting purchases based on compliance with state mandates, a realization of ‚Äúthe mark‚Äù prophecy from Revelation.Breaking the Cycle of Monetary OppressionHistorical patterns confirm that monetary systems inherently centralize power and erode individual autonomy. From Babylonian debt slavery to CBDC surveillance, elites have weaponized finance to enforce compliance. Liberation requires rejecting debt-based currencies and centralized banking, returning to asset-backed money and decentralized exchange mechanisms outside institutional control. Only through monetary sovereignty can societies escape what Ezra Pound termed ‚Äúa system of legalized counterfeiting‚Äù enriching few at the expense of many.","{'comment_id': 't1_mv25p69', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/conspiracy/comments/1kz3fjm/comment/mv25p69/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': '[Meta] Sticky CommentRule 2does not applywhen replying to this stickied comment.Rule 2does applythroughout the rest of this thread.What this means: Please keep any ""meta"" discussion directed at specific users, mods, orr/conspiracyin general in this comment chainonly.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just because you can find something you think is similar/wrong that doesn\'t mean your alternative system is an acceptable substitute.Whatever thing in modern/traditional society also might be sketchy is irrelevant.  Chances are crypto\'s version of itis even worse, less accountable and more sketchy.At least in traditional society, with banks, stocks, and fiat, there are more controls, more regulations and more agencies specifically tasked with policing these industries and making sure tominimizebad things happening.  (Just because we can\'t eliminateallcriminal activity in a particular market doesn\'t mean crypto would be an improvement - there\'s ZERO evidence for that.)Stocks are not a ponzi scheme. In a ponzi, there is no value created through honest work/sales. You can hold a stock and still make money when that company produces products people pay for. Stocks also represent fractional ownership of companies that have real-world assets. Crypto has no such properties.When people say more fiat is used in crime than crypto, this isn\'t surprising.  Fiat is used by 99.99% of society as the main payment method.  Crypto is used by 0.01% of society.  So of course more fiat will be used in crime.  There\'s proportionately more of it in circulation and use.  That doesn\'t mean fiat is bad.  In fact as a proportion of the total in circulation, more crypto isused in crimethan fiat.  It\'s estimated that as much as23-45% of crypto is used for criminal purposes.Fiat is not the same as crypto.  Fiat, even if it\'s intangible and has no intrinsic value, it is backed by the full faith/force of the government that issues it, the same government that provides the necessary utilities and services we depend upon every day that we often take for granted.  Crypto has no such backing. Calling fiat a ""Ponzi"" also showsa lack of understanding of what a Ponzi scheme is.', 'replies': []}]}]}]}]}",2025-08-04T01:03:42.113423,"['Negative', 'Potentially inaccurate claim about taxpayer money being wasted.', 'New Hampshire passed a law about digital tokens; post criticizes it.']","['Humorous', 'None', 'Rhode Island is happy to not be seen as the most gullible in New England anymore.']","['Negative', 'Potentially, depending on the bill and sponsorship details.', 'Bill sponsored by Republicans, commenter expresses surprise.']","['Negative', 'None', 'The strategic reserve will be depleted completely eventually.']","['Angry', 'None', 'Corruption is unacceptable; Republicans should oppose it on fiscal grounds.']","['Negative', 'None', ""Taxpayer money shouldn't be used for NFTs; it's incredibly stupid.""]"
Blockchain-Based Payment Systems,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/1gr4y9g/blockchainbased_payment_systems/,r/BlockchainStartups,2024-11-14T13:38:30.246000+0000,1,2,"Blockchain is becoming a force in payment systems bestowing new speed,security, and accessibility in the sending and receiving of money, especiallywhere traditional banking infrastructure falls short. By utilizingdecentralized, secure, and transparent methods of transfer value,blockchain technology has a transformative impact on payment systems.Different payment systems in the world are currently using blockchain toperform transactions, especially for cross-border payments, remittances,digital wallets, and some government-backed currencies.Advantage of blockchain in payment systemSecurity: Its problem-solving strength lies in its ability to use cryptographictechniques which ensure data integrity and that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs useful, to limitfraud in payments.Transparency: This provides key accountability with aid for audit trails forevery transaction on a blockchain, occurring in a ledger visible toauthorized parties.Speed: Concerning cross-border payments, blockchain can cut down ontransaction times by a large margin. Blockchain payments can be nearinstant, but traditional systems can take days.Lower Transaction Costs: The blockchain facilitated a reduction in costs fortransactions, which makes it especially helpful with micropayments andcross-border transfers.Payment Systems applications.Cross-Border Payments: Blockchain is popular in internationalpayments, where it simplifies the process by getting rid of multipleintermediaries that, for example with money transfer via the SWIFTsystem, made the process more time-consuming and expensive.2. Remittances: These remittance payments are vital for many people,but are too often sent through expensive, slow channels. To helpworkers overseas send money to their families, blockchain-basedservices have made it efficient and cheaper at the same time.3. Digital Currencies (e.g., CBDCs): A growing number of governmentsare experimenting with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) ‚Äìusing blockchain to create digital representations of national moneyto facilitate faster and more efficient domestic payments.4. Payment Gateways and Merchant Adoption: Blocks can be used bybusinesses to allow customers to spend payment without thetraditional credit or debit card, instead, via cryptocurrencies.5. Smart Contracts for Automated Payments: Since recurring payments,escrow arrangements, and especially decentralized finance (DeFi)applications are quite common, this is useful.Limitations¬∑ Regulatory Concerns: Blockchain payments are only recentlyregulated in many countries, especially about anti-money laundering(AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules.¬∑ Scalability: Although a proof of concept, the theoretical fundamentals(complementary proof of stake methods and distributed consensusfor creating distributed data structures) were applied to Bitcoin in oneof the first implementations. Some blockchains particularly earlyversions like Bitcoin lack the scalability to handle heavy bandwidths(i.e. transaction times are slow and fees spike at peak periods).¬∑ Volatility in Cryptocurrencies: While blockchain is for differentcryptocurrencies, value can go up or down dramatically. New isstablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currency but are still very new.Integration with¬∑ Legacy Systems: The process of transitioning to a blockchain is arather big challenge for traditional financial institutions.Future OutlookWith their growing gains in payments, blockchain is expected to continuegrowing in various payment areas, such as cross-border transactions andremittances. Overall, blockchain technology offers great promise as analternative to traditional payment systems due to the increased speed,security, and accessibility ‚Äî wherever there are people ‚Äî which may beparticularly beneficial in underserved areas. This, however, will likely needsome regulatory support and technological innovation to spread, widely.Payment systems currently using blockchain technology.Cross-Border PaymentsRipple (XRP): Financial institutions use Ripple Labs&#39; paymentnetwork, RippleNet, to make cross-border transactions. Ripple‚Äôsblockchain solution is based on near-instant settlement oftransactions which is an alternative to SWIFT systems and reducesboth time and costs.2. Stellar (XLM): Another blockchain platform for cross-border paymentsis Stellar. It enables low-cost and fast transactions, which is mostuseful in making payments between uncommon or differentcurrencies. IBM has partnered with another Stellar project on cross-border payments.Digital Remittances3. MoneyGram and USDC: To collateralize cross-border remittances,the Stellar blockchain was partnered with MoneyGram to use theirUSDC stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar. It means users can sendmoney across borders at greatly reduced fees and faster processingtime.4. Western Union: Taking a leaf out of its competitors‚Äô book, WesternUnion has been exploring blockchain to help speed up its remittanceservices. They have not moved all the way but have tested multiplepilots on blockchain platforms to speed up and make cheaper,transfers.Central Bank Digital Currencies5. China‚Äôs Digital Yuan: They become one of the first major economiesthat go on the road towards a central bank digital currency (CBDC)using blockchain tech. China‚Äôs Digital Yuan plans to modernize thecountry‚Äôs payment system of state-backed digital transactions fordomestic consumers.6. Bahamas‚Äô Sand Dollar: In early 2020, the Bahamas launched its ownfully implemented CBDC, one of the first. The network is built onblockchain to allow secure transactions and bring financial inclusionto remote islands without banking access.7. European Union and Digital Euro: As an alternative payment systemwithin the EU, the European Central Bank (ECB) is currentlyexploring using a blockchain-based &#39;Digital Euro&#39;. It wants to be asafe digital asset that complements cash in retail payments.Payment Processors for Cryptocurrency8. BitPay: Merchants can accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies withBitPay. With that, the project mitigates the risk of volatility formerchants and allows consumers to pay with their digital assets byconverting the cryptocurrency into fiat at sale time.9. Coinbase Commerce: The market payment system is Coinbase‚Äôsproposal for businesses to be able to accept cryptocurrencypayments: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. Coinbase Commerceintegrates with online stores so merchants can make crypto easier forboth sides.Stablecoins for Transactions10. Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC): Used in blockchain-basedpayment systems as instant yet stable value settlement vehicles,these stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar. In regions with highinflation, stablecoins are a favorite among users because they allowpeople to send money around without worrying about the volatility ofother cryptocurrencies.11. Diem (formerly Libra): Diem never launched, but its vision was astimulus for stablecoins for payments and inspired financialinstitutions to start their own digital currency projects.Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Blockchain Payment Networks12. Lightning Network (for Bitcoin): By processing off-chain, theLightning Network was designed for small, fast transactions(micropayments). That means you can use Bitcoin for real-time, low-fee payments.13.DeFi Payment Apps (e.g., Uniswap): DeFi platforms allow peer-to-peer payments and decentralized exchanges without the need fortraditional banks to transfer or exchange those assets they have. ButDeFi apps are moving away from being primarily a tradingmechanism, and are increasingly enabling peer-to-peer payments.NFTs and Tokenized Payments14. Ticket Sales and Events: For example, now some companies placetheir ticket for an event in the form of NFT. This technology can solveproblems like coordinating the ticketing process, fighting fraud, andtransferring or reselling tickets easily and quickly.15. Loyalty Programs and Rewards: Token-based loyalty programs arealso gaining traction as blockchain use cases. For example,Starbucks has implemented its loyalty program through blockchainthat allows users to earn ‚Äòpoints‚Äô (in token form) that can beredeemed for or traded for rewards.Government and non-government Trials16. India‚Äôs e-Rupee: India is testing a digital currency that will increaseaccess to financial services for the unbanked. The e-rupee isbelieved to work as a blockchain-backed payment method, more orless for domestic use.17. Switzerland‚Äôs Project Helvetia: Instead, the Swiss National Bank haspartnered with each other on a wholesale CBDC that would operateon a blockchain. Project Helvetia is an experiment of digital centralbank money for commercial banks in the Swiss financial system.","{'comment_id': 't1_lx31wuq', 'upvote': 1, 'depth': 0, 'permalink': '/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/1gr4y9g/comment/lx31wuq/', 'parent_id': '', 'comment_body': 'Thanks for posting onr/BlockchainStartups!Check the TOP posts of the WEEK.CLICK HEREModeratorsofr/BlockchainStartupsI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
